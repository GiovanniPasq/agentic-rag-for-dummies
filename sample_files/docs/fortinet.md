## TOE OVERVIEW 1.4

The TOE is a group of network appliances designed to provide firewall, Virtual Private Network (VPN), Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN), antivirus protection, antispam protection and content filtering to provide network protection for Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4) and Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) networks. The FortiGate Family of Next Generation Firewalls span the full range of network environments, from the remote office and branch office (ROBO) to service provider, offering cost-effective systems for any size of application. They are hardware security systems designed to protect computer networks from abuse. They reside between the network they are protecting and an external network, such as the Internet, restricting the information flow between them permitted by policies (set of rules) defined by an authorized administrator. They detect and eliminate the most damaging, content-based threats from email and Web traffic such as viruses, worms, and intrusions in real-time, without degrading network performance. In addition to providing application-level protection, the FortiGate series uses dedicated, easily managed platforms to deliver a full range of network-level services including: VPN, Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN), Network Address Translation (NAT), intrusion protection, web filtering, antivirus, antispam, and traffic shaping. Each FortiGate unit consists of a hardware box and the FortiOSâ„¢ custom NGFW firmware. Administration of the system may be performed locally using an administrator console, or remotely via a network management station. The FortiGate NGFW can operate either alone or as part of a cluster in order to provide high availability of services. Due to having different device drivers, the models offered in the FortiGate Series have their own unique firmware image created from the same firmware build. The different models in the series provide for increased performance and additional protected ports. All CC-evaluated FortiGate NGFW employ Fortinet's unique FortiASIC â„¢  processor and the powerful, secure, FortiOS â„¢  operating system to achieve breakthrough price/performance. The Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) processors accelerate network security in Fortinet platforms. The purpose built, highperformance network and content processors use intelligent and proprietary digital engines to accelerate compute-intensive security services. With the FortiOS, they provide a critical layer of real-time, network-based antivirus protection that complements host-based antivirus software and supports 'defence-in-depth' strategies without compromising performance or cost. They can be deployed to provide antivirus protection, antispam protection and content filtering in conjunction with existing firewall, VPN, VLAN, and related devices, or to provide complete network protection. The FortiGate series supports the Internet Protocol Security (IPsec) industry standard for VPN, allowing VPNs to be configured between a FortiGate model and any client or gateway/firewall that supports IPsec VPN. The FortiGate series also provides Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) VPN services.

FortiGate's firewall, web filtering, VPN, antivirus and intrusion detection/prevention security functionality are within the scope of this evaluation. The antispam, content filtering and traffic shaping features are not included in this evaluation.

## TOE Features 1.4.1

The function of the FortiGate Series is to isolate two or more networks from each other and arbitrate the information transfers between these networks. Arbitration is based on a set of policies (rules) that are established by an authorized administrator and applied to each data packet that flows through the system. The TOE arbitrates all data that travels through it from one network to another.

The FortiGate has a FIPS-CC Mode which, when enabled by an authorized administrator, provides the capability claimed in this ST. FIPS-CC Mode provides initial default values, and enforces the FIPS configuration requirements.

Table 7 summarizes the most security-relevant FortiGate features.

| Authentication (FortiToken)           | The FortiGate provides an option of using a FortiToken one-time password generator for remote administrator and user authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Cryptography                          | The FortiGate incorporates a cryptographic module 1 .                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Firewall (Information Flow Control)   | FortiGate Next Generation Firewalls implement a stateful traffic filtering firewall. Information flow is restricted to that permitted by a policy (set of rules) defined by an authorized administrator. The default policy is restrictive (i.e., no traffic flows without administrator action to configure policy).                                                                                                 |
| FortiGuard Web Filtering              | When a request for a web page appears in traffic controlled by the FortiGate unit, the Universal Resource Locator (URL) is sent to a FortiGuard server and the URL category is returned. The FortiGate unit determines if the URL should be allowed or blocked based on the category and the implemented policy.                                                                                                      |
| High Availability (FortiGate Cluster) | The FortiGate Series provides a high availability capability between two or more identical units communicating via the FortiGate clustering protocol. Two modes of operation are supported: active-passive for failover protection and active- active for failover protection and load balancing.                                                                                                                     |
| Intrusion Prevention System           | FortiGate units use signatures to detect and prevent attacks to the data passing through them. The IPS attack signatures may be updated manually or the FortiGate unit may be configured to automatically download updates. The TOE also includes local anomaly detection to protect itself from direct attacks such as denial of service (DoS) attacks.                                                              |
| IPv6                                  | Both an IPv4 and an IPv6 address may be assigned to any interface on a FortiGate unit. The interface functions as two interfaces; one for IPv4-addressed packets and another for IPv6-addressed packets. The FortiGate series supports static routing, periodic router advertisements, and tunnelling of IPv6- addressed traffic over an IPv4-addressed network. All relevant security claims apply to IPv4 and IPv6. |
| Logging (management)                  | The FortiGate supports management activities for configuration and management of logging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Logging (recording)                   | Logging is performed and data is stored in memory, written to hard disk, or written to a FLASH memory card depending on the FortiGate model.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Protection Profile 2 | Protection profiles are used to configure anti-virus protection, and IPS.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Proxies              | Firewall rules may be defined that are applicable only to users who have authenticated to the firewall in order to use a proxy service. The evaluated configuration supports user authentication for the File Transfer Protocol (FTP), HTTP and Telnet protocols.                        |
| Static Routing       | Static routes are configured by defining the destination IP address and netmask of packets that the FortiGate unit is intended to intercept, and specifying a (gateway) IP address for those packets. The gateway address specifies the next-hop router to which traffic will be routed. |
| Time                 | The FortiGate maintains internal time on a system clock, settable by an authorized administrator. This clock is used when time stamps are generated.                                                                                                                                     |
| VLAN                 | The FortiGate supports VLAN as a sub interface attached to a physical interface port. The firewall rules detailed herein may be applied to VLANs.                                                                                                                                        |
| VPN                  | The FortiGate supports VPN using SSL or IPsec to provide a secure connection between widely separated office networks or to securely link telecommuters or travellers to an office network.                                                                                              |

## Table 7 - TOE Features

## TOE DESCRIPTION 1.5

## Physical Scope 1.5.1

## Physical Configuration 1.5.1.1

The FortiGate (see models listed in Tables 1 to 4) are stand-alone appliances that do not require supporting hardware. The FG-5001A, FG-5001B, FG-5001C, FG5001D, FG-5101C and FSW-5203B are Next Generation Firewall modules (blades) that may be installed in the FortiGate-5020, 5060 or 5140B chassis, each of which is capable of holding multiple blades. The chassis supports the blades by providing mounting, power and cooling fans only. As network and management interfaces are part of the blade itself, each blade acts as an independent Next Generation Firewall. The FortiGate-VM models in Table 6 are virtual machines.

2 The term 'Protection Profile' is the name given to a set of Fortinet security rules, and should not be confused with Common Criteria PPs.

Each series member of the FortiGate Next Generation Firewalls, termed a FortiGate unit, consists of custom hardware and firmware with the exception of the FortiGateVM models. The FortiGate unit consists of the following major components: FortiOS FIPS-CC compliant firmware, processor, memory, FortiASICâ„¢, and input/output interfaces. All models share a common software platform. All hardware modes use one of Fortinet's proprietary ASIC (FortiASICâ„¢) models to improve performance. The FortiASICâ„¢ is a hardware device which provides cryptographic services to a FortiGate unit. The FortiASICâ„¢ performs security and content processing. The FortiGate-VM models consist of software only and are supported by VMware Servers.

## Network Interfaces 1.5.1.2

The FortiGate units may be securely administered over the external or internal networks, or locally within the secure area. The FortiGate units provide the following administration options:

- A dedicated console port is available on all models. The port is RS232 with either a DB-9 or RJ-45 connector. When connected to a terminal which supports VT100 emulation, the console port allows access to the FortiGate unit via the CLI. This Local Console CLI permits an authorized administrator to configure the FortiGate unit, monitor its operation, and examine the audit logs that are created.
- Remote administration may be performed on all models through any network port that has been configured by an authorized administrator to allow HTTPS for the Network Web-Based GUI. When connected to a Network Management Station, this port provides remote access to the Network Web-Based GUI and allows an authorized administrator to configure the FortiGate Unit, monitor its operation, and examine the audit logs that are created.
- All models are equipped with a Universal Serial Bus (USB) port that may be used by an authorized administrator to use the Fortinet token hardware entropy source. This is required for FIPS mode operation.
- On all models, an authorized administrator may configure logging information to be sent to a FortiAnalyzer unit.
- On all models, an authorized administrator may configure automatic AntiVirus and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) updates from the FortiGuard Distribution Server.

The FortiGate units are designed to be installed and used in an environment that is configured and controlled in accordance with the administrator guidance that is supplied with the product.

## TOE Boundary - Single-Unit Configuration 1.5.1.3

In the single-unit configuration, which is supported by all of the FortiGate series, the TOE consists of a single FortiGate unit. The FortiGate unit controls network access by implementing classic firewall concepts, in which the firewall is linked to two or more networks and controls the transfer of data between them. The

configuration supports additional networks, each of which is physically connected to one of the included network interfaces. Figure 1 shows an example of a single FortiGate unit mediating information flow between two networks. One of the networks provides access to the FortiGuard Distribution Server, which permits Anti-Virus and IPS updates to be downloaded and facilitates access to Web filtering data. It also provides access to the FortiAnalyzer Server, which collects and analyzes logging information. The Local Console, located within a Secure Area, is a terminal or general purpose computer with a standard serial interface and optional Ethernet interfaces. A serial port is required to administer the TOE via the Local Console CLI. The Network Management Station is a terminal or general purpose computer with a standard network interface used to administer the TOE remotely using the Network Web-based GUI. Note that the Fortinet FortiASIC CP7 Cryptographic Library and the Fortinet FortiASIC CP8 Cryptographic Library are considered to be in the operational environment.

## TOE Boundary - High-Availability Configuration 1.5.1.4

In the High Availability (HA) configuration, which is supported by all FortiGate units, the TOE consists of two or more FortiGate units interconnected to form a FortiGate Cluster. The FortiGate Cluster controls network access by implementing classic firewall concepts, in which the firewall is linked to two or more networks and controls the transfer of data between them. The configuration supports additional

networks, each of which is physically connected to one of the included network interfaces. Figure 2 shows three FortiGate units of the same type configured in HA mode to form a FortiGate Cluster. A FortiGate Cluster may be configured to work in activepassive mode for failover protection or in active-active mode for failover protection and load balancing. Both active-passive mode and active-active mode are part of the evaluated configuration of the TOE. The cluster units share state and configuration information over a dedicated High Availability Link. The TOE accesses the FortiGuard Distribution Server, which permits Anti-Virus and Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System (IDS/IPS) updates to be downloaded, and a FortiAnalyzer Server, which collects and analyzes logging information. The Local Console, located within a Secure Area, is a terminal or general purpose computer with a standard serial interface and optional Ethernet interfaces. A serial port is required to administer the TOE via the Local Console CLI. The Network Management Station is a terminal or general purpose computer with a standard network interface to administer the TOE remotely using the Network Webbased GUI.

## Logical Scope 1.5.2

The logical scope of the TOE may be broken down by the security function classes. The following breakdown provides the description of the security features of the TOE, and loosely follows the security functional classes described in Section 5.1 and Section 6.2.

## Security Audit 1.5.2.1

The TOE generates audit records for security relevant events. An administrator may view the contents of the audit records; however, this functionality is restricted to only those users authorized to view the records.

## Cryptographic Support 1.5.2.2

The TOE provides key generation, key destruction and cryptographic operation functions supported by CAVP-validated algorithms.

## User Data Protection 1.5.2.3

The TOE provides interfaces to a defined set of networks and mediates information flow among these networks. The TOE supports the information flow control policies required for authenticated and unauthenticated service. Additionally, the TOE supports a VPN information flow control policy and a Web filtering information flow control policy.

## Identification and Authentication 1.5.2.4

All TOE administrative users must be identified and authenticated. Administration may either be performed locally using the Local Console CLI or remotely using the Network Web-based GUI. TOE users may be required to authenticate in order to access an internal or external network. The TOE blocks users after a configurable number of authentication failures, after which an administrator must intervene to allow access.

## Security Management 1.5.2.5

The TOE provides administrative interfaces that permit users in administrative roles to configure and manage the TOE. In each of the two evaluated configurations (i.e., the Single-Unit Configuration and High-Availability Configuration), the TOE is connected to two or more networks and remote administration data flows from a Network Management workstation to the TOE. In each configuration there is also a Local Console, located within a Secure Area, with an interface to the TOE. An administrator account is associated with an access profile which determines the permissions of the individual administrator. Additionally, each FortiGate unit comes with a default administrator account with all permissions, which may not be deleted. The terms 'administrator' and 'authorized administrator' are used throughout this ST to describe an administrator given the appropriate permission to perform tasks as required.

## Protection of the TOE Security Functionality (TSF) 1.5.2.6

The TOE provides failover in support of the high availability features. Reliable time stamps are provided in support of the audit function.

## Trusted Path/Channels 1.5.2.7

A trusted path communication is required for the authentication of administrators and users of TOE services that require authentication. A remote administrator's communication remains encrypted throughout the remote session. The TOE requires an encrypted trusted channel for communication between FortiGate devices in support of the High Availability configuration.

## IPS Functionality 1.5.2.8

The TOE provides IPS functionality to recognize and block potential Denial of Service attacks, and to recognize and block attacks based on known attack signatures.

## Anti-Virus Functionality 1.5.2.9

The TOE supports anti-virus detection and the ability to block or quarantine suspected information. A secure mechanism is used to update virus signatures.

## CONFORMANCE CLAIMS 2

## COMMON CRITERIA CONFORMANCE CLAIM 2.1

This ST has been prepared in accordance with the Common Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation (CC), Version 3.1 Revision 4, September 2012. This ST contains functional requirements based upon functional components in CC Part 2 as well as a number of extended security functional requirements. Therefore, the TOE is conformant with CC Part 2 extended. The TOE for this ST is conformant to the CC Part 3 assurance requirements for EAL 4, augmented with ALC\_FLR.3 - Systematic Flaw Remediation.

## PROTECTION PROFILE CONFORMANCE CLAIM 2.2

Conformance to a PP is not claimed in this ST.

## SECURITY PROBLEM DEFINITION 3

## THREATS, POLICIES, AND ASSUMPTIONS 3.1

## Threats 3.1.1

The threats discussed below are addressed by the TOE. Potential threat agents are unauthorized persons or external IT entities not authorized to use the TOE itself. The threat agents are assumed to have a low to moderate attack potential and are assumed to have a moderate level of resources and access to all publicly available information about the TOE and potential methods of attacking the TOE. It is expected that the FortiGate units will be protected to the extent necessary to ensure that they remain connected to the networks they protect.

## SECURITY OBJECTIVES 4

This section describes the security objectives for the TOE and the TOE's operating environment. The security objectives are divided between TOE Security Objectives (i.e., security objectives addressed directly by the TOE) and Security Objectives for the Operational Environment (i.e., security objectives addressed by the IT domain or by non-technical or procedural means). The mapping of security objectives to assumptions, threats and organizational security policies along with the rationale for this mapping is found in Section 4.3.

## SECURITY OBJECTIVES FOR THE TOE 4.1

This section defines the security objectives that are to be addressed by the TOE.

Table 13 - Security Objectives for the TOE

| Objective ID   | Objective Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

## EXTENDED COMPONENTS DEFINITION 5

This section specifies the extended Security Functional Requirements (SFR)s used in this ST.

## EXTENDED TOE SECURITY FUNCTIONAL 5.1 COMPONENTS

This section specifies the extended SFRs for the TOE. The extended SFRs are organized by class. Table 16 identifies all extended SFRs implemented by the TOE.

Table 16 - Extended TOE Security Functional Requirements

| Name          | Description                    |
|---------------|--------------------------------|
| FAV_ACT_EXT.1 | Anti-Virus action requirements |
| FIP_DOS_EXT.1 | Denial of service              |
| FIP_SIG_EXT.1 | Signature protection           |

## Anti-Virus Action Requirements (FAV) 5.1.1

## FAV\_ACT\_EXT.1 5.1.1.1

This extended requirement was explicitly created because the CC does not provide a means to specify Anti-Virus detection and blocking capabilities. A new class is explicitly created and it has a family of FAV\_ACT\_EXT. The Anti-Virus class and family were modelled after FPT\_PHP TSF physical protection, and FAV\_ACT\_EXT.1 was loosely modelled after FPT\_PHP.1 Passive detection of physical attack. Component levelling is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 3 - FAV\_ACT\_EXT Component Levelling

## Management: FAV\_ACT\_EXT.1

The following actions could be considered for the management functions in FMT:

- The management of actions on the information flow when virus is detected;
- The management of actions on virus signatures.

## Audit: FAV\_ACT\_EXT.1

The following actions should be auditable:

Doc No: 1918-002-D002

Date: 20 September 2016

- Minimal: actions taken on the information flow when virus is detected.

Hierarchical to:

No other components.

Dependencies:

No dependencies.

FAV\_ACT\_EXT.1.1 The TSF shall provide an authorized administrator the capability to select one or more of the following actions: [selection: quarantine the content of the information flow, remove the content of the information flow, [ assignment: other action ]] to be taken on detection of a virus in an information flow.

FAV\_ACT\_EXT.1.2 The TSF shall provide a secure mechanism to update the virus

signatures used by the TSF.

Application Note : Virus signature updates consist of updates to both the virus signature database and the processing engine for the detection of virus attacks. The TOE provides specific guidance to administrators noting that in the evaluated configuration of the TOE, only the virus signature database updates may be applied to the TOE.

## Intrusion Prevention (IPS) Class 5.1.2

A class of FIP requirements was created to address the intrusion prevention functionality provided by the TOE. The FPT Protection of the TSF class was used as a model for creating these requirements. The purpose of this class of requirements is to address the Denial of Service (DoS) and signature based protection functionality provided by the TOE. This class of requirements has two families -FIP\_DOS and FIP\_SIG. These requirements have no dependencies; the stated requirements embody all the necessary security functions. Component levelling is shown in Figure 4.

FIP\_DOS\_EXT: Denial of Service

FIP\_SIG\_EXT: Signature Protection

The image depicts a blockwise comparison between two variables, labeled FIP_DOS_EXT: Denial of Service and FIP_SIG_EXT: Signature Protection. The variables are represented by square brackets, and the comparison is performed on them.

### Description of the Image:

#### FIP_DOS_EXT: Denial of Service
- **Description**: The variable FIP_DOS_EXT: Denial of Service is the variable being compared.
- **Description**: Denial of Service is a condition that is being tested for.
- **Description**: Denial of Service is a measure of the number of requests made by a user.
- **Description**: Denial of Service is a measure of the number of requests made by a user.
- **Description**: Denial of Service is a measure of the number of requests made by a user.

## Management: FIP\_DOS\_EXT.1

The following actions could be considered for management functions in the FMT:

- Configuration of DoS policy.

Audit:

FIP\_DOS\_EXT.1

The following actions should be auditable if FAU\_GEN Security audit data generation is included in the PP/ST:

- Detection of a possible DoS attack.

Hierarchical to:

No other components.

Dependencies:

No dependencies.

FIP\_DOS\_EXT.1.1

The TSF shall be able to recognize and block potential Denial of Service attacks.

## FIP\_ SIG\_EXT.1 Signature Protection 5.1.2.2

Management:

FIP\_SIG\_EXT.1

The following actions could be considered for the management functions in FMT:

- Configuration of IPS policies
- Update of IPS signatures

Audit:

FIP\_SIG\_EXT.1

The following actions should be auditable if FAU\_GEN Security audit data generation is included in the PP/ST:

- Basic: Detection of a possible attack incident
- Basic: Update of the signature protection file.

Hierarchical to:

No other components.

Dependencies:

No dependencies.

FIP\_SIG\_EXT.1.1

The TSF shall detect and block potential attacks based on similarities to known attack signatures.

## EXTENDED TOE SECURITY ASSURANCE 5.2 COMPONENTS

There are no extended TOE Security Assurance components associated with this evaluation.

Doc No: 1918-002-D002

Date: 20 September 2016

## SECURITY REQUIREMENTS 6

This section provides the security functional and assurance requirements that must be satisfied by a compliant TOE. These requirements consist of functional components from Part 2 of the CC, extended requirements, and an Evaluation Assurance Level that contains assurance components from Part 3 of the CC.

## CONVENTIONS 6.1

The CC permits four types of operations to be performed on functional requirements: selection, assignment, refinement, and iteration. These operations, when performed on requirements that derive from CC Part 2 are identified in this ST in the following manner:

- Selection: Indicated by surrounding brackets, e.g., [selected item]. To improve readability selections of [none] are generally not shown.
- Assignment: Indicated by surrounding brackets and italics, e.g., [ assigned item ]. To improve readability, assignments of [ none ] may not be shown.
- Refinement: Refined components are identified by using bold additional information, or strikeout for deleted text.
- Iteration: Indicated by assigning a number in parenthesis to the end of the functional component identifier as well as by modifying the functional component title to distinguish between iterations, e.g., 'FDP\_ACC.1(1), Subset access control (administrators)' and 'FDP\_ACC.1(2) Subset access control (devices)'.

## TOE SECURITY FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS 6.2

The security functional requirements for this ST consist of the following components from Part 2 of the CC, and extended components defined in Section 5.

Application Note: The FortiGuard web filtering service assigns all websites to a category based on content. Those not assigned to other categories are assigned to the 'Unrated' category. Category groups are similar categories grouped together for ease of administration. A classification is assigned based on the characteristics of the site rather than the site content. For example, the cached content classification indicates that the site caches content, but provides no indication of the content type. Not every URL has an assigned classification. A quota is a time limit placed on viewing URLs assigned to a particular category, category group or classification.

## TOE SECURITY ASSURANCE REQUIREMENTS 6.5

The TOE assurance requirements for this ST consist of the requirements corresponding to the EAL 4 level of assurance, as defined in the CC Part 3, augmented by the inclusion of Systematic Flaw Remediation (ALC\_FLR.3). EAL 4 was chosen for competitive reasons. The developer is claiming the ALC\_FLR.3 augmentation since current Fortinet flaw remediation practices and procedures meet or exceed this level of assurance.

The assurance requirements are summarized in Table 23.

## TOE SUMMARY SPECIFICATION 7

This section provides a description of the security functions and assurance measures of the TOE that meet the TOE security requirements.

## TOE SECURITY FUNCTIONS 7.1

A description of each of the TOE security functions follows.

## Security Audit 7.1.1

The TOE creates audit records for administrative events, potential policy violations and information flow decisions. The TOE records the identity of the administrator or user who caused the event for which the audit record is created. The TOE applies timestamps to auditable events as they occur. The administrator can review the audit records. The audit records are stored locally, using memory, a hard disk or a FLASH memory card depending on the model. If the TOE is operating as part of an Active-Active HA cluster, the HA master logs all administrative events for the cluster. The status of each node in a clustered TOE is identified by a heartbeat. When the heartbeat response is not received from a slave node, the master node no longer routes packets to the failed node. In the event that the master fails, an existing node in the cluster will be promoted to become the master node. The HA master also logs all potential policy violations and information flow decisions that it processes. HA slaves log all potential policy violations and information flow decisions that they process. The administrator can access slave audit records through the master HA unit. If the audit log of any node in a cluster becomes full, that node takes the action specified for the master node. If this action is to shut down the TOE interfaces the following will result:

- a. If the audit log of a slave node becomes full (active-active cluster), the slave node drops out of the cluster;
- b. If the audit log of a master node becomes full (active-active cluster), the master node has failed and one of the slave nodes will become the new master node; and
- c. If the audit log of the master node (active-passive cluster) becomes full, the master node has failed and the backup node will take over as the master node.

Logs may be read using the CLI or the web interface on the FortiGate unit. This functionality is provided by default to the primary administrator account, and must be specifically granted to any administrator account that may be created. TOE Security Functional Requirements addressed: FAU\_GEN.1, FAU\_GEN.2, FAU\_SAR.1, FAU\_SAR.2.

## Cryptographic Support 7.1.2

## Table 24 - Cryptographic Libraries

Fortinet has verified the correctness of the implementation of the cryptographic support to fulfil the requirements stated in Section 6.2.2.

Cryptographic support is provided using a firmware based, deterministic random bit generator (DRBG) that conforms to NIST Special Publication 800-90A. This generates cryptographic keys whose strengths are modified by available entropy. Cryptographic support is provided using a Fortinet entropy token to seed the DRBG during the boot process and to periodically reseed the DRBG. Operation of the token is based on a wide-band Gaussian white noise generator and provides a source of entropy. The default reseed period is once every 24 hours (1440 minutes). The token is connected to the Fortinet hardware device or virtual machine hardware using a standard USB interface, and must be installed to complete the boot process and to reseed of the DRBG. The entropy token is responsible for loading a minimum of 256 bits of entropy.

Each FortiGate unit is delivered with a factory installed 2048-bit RSA public/private key pair. Asymmetric keys are also generated in support of TLS functionality.

Cryptographic key destruction meets the key zeroization requirements of Key Management Security Level 1 from FIPS PUB 140-2. The TOE only stores keys in memory, either in Synchronous Dynamic Random Access Memory (SDRAM) or Flash Random Access Memory (RAM). Keys are destroyed by overwriting the key storage area with an alternating pattern at least once.

Cryptographic operations are performed in accordance with the detail provided in Table 20. Note that the Fortinet FortiASIC CP7 Cryptographic Library and the Fortinet FortiASIC CP8 Cryptographic Library are considered to be in the operational environment.

TOE Security Functional Requirements addressed: FCS\_CKM.1(1), FCS\_CKM.1(2), FCS\_CKM.4, FCS\_COP.1.

## User Data Protection 7.1.3

The TOE operates in accordance with four information flow security functional policies:

- a. The Unauthenticated Information Flow SFP allows unauthenticated users to pass information through the TOE, with firewall mediation according to the firewall rules defined by an authorized administrator;
- b. The Authenticated Information Flow SFP allows authenticated users to pass information through the TOE, with firewall mediation according to the firewall rules defined by an authorized administrator;
- c. The VPN SFP allows authenticated users to send and receive information protected using IPsec to and from the TOE; and
- d. The Web Filtering SFP allows users to access only those URLs which are allowed.

The security functional policies are implemented as firewall rules. The rules that implement the Unauthenticated Information Flow, Authenticated Information Flow and VPN SFPs have restrictive default values and by default no information is allowed to flow, and TOE services are not available to unauthenticated users. The Web Filtering SFP has permissive default values, and does not block URLs until specifically identified. Regardless of firewall rules, packets which include parameters as specified by the security functional requirements which define the security functional policies are never permitted to pass through the TOE. Modification of the rules is restricted to an authorized administrator, and an authorized administrator may also specify alternative initial values to override the default values. The TOE allows an authorized administrator to view all information flows allowed by the information flow policy rules before the rules are applied. The TOE mediates all information flows which pass through it. For information to pass through the TOE, it must match one of an authorized administrator specified firewall rules which permit the information flow. The TOE ensures that all information flows provided to the TOE by external entities for transfer to other entities are subjected to the defined firewall rules and conform to them before they are allowed to proceed toward the destination entity. The TSF immediately enforces revocation of a user's permission to use the information flow and also immediately enforces changes to the information flow policy rules when applied. The TOE also immediately enforces the disabling of a service which was available to an unauthenticated user. The VPN functionality supports IPsec tunnel mode. An IPsec tunnel may be established between two FortiGate units, or between a client application and the FortiGate device. Authentication for IPsec services may be performed using Internet Key Exchange (IKE) pre-shared key or IKE RSA key. The IPsec VPN functionality is implemented through the Encapsulated Security Payload (ESP) protocol. When in FIPS-CC mode, TOE devices support IKEv1, as defined in RFCs 2407, 2408, 2409, RFC 4109, and RFC 4868 (for hash functions), and IKEv2 as defined in RFC 5996 (with mandatory support for NAT traversal as specified in section 2.23), RFC 4307, and RFC 4868 (for hash functions). IKEv1 Security Association (SA) lifetimes may

be limited to 24 hours for Phase 1 SAs, and 8 hours for Phase 2 SAs. IKEv1 SA lifetimes may also be limited by traffic volume. This value is determined during the configuration of the Phase 2 parameters, and may be set to between 100 and 200 MB of traffic for the specified SA. Once the lifetime for the SA has been reached, the TOE device will renegotiate the SA. IKE protocols support the use of DiffieHellman (DH) Groups 1 (with 768-bit MODP 5 ), 2 (with 1024-bit MODP), 5 (with 1536-bit MODP), and 14 (with 2048-bit MODP). The use of pre-shared keys is supported for authenticating IPsec peer connections. Pre-shared keys may be between 6 and 32 characters in length, and may be composed of upper and lower case letters, numbers and special characters. Certificate based authentication may also be used. The TOE follows a sequence of ordered steps in order to decide whether or not a requested information flow is allowed to proceed. The very first processing step performed by the FortiGate unit on incoming information is an inspection for IPS anomalies which target the TOE directly. Examples of IPS anomalies include syn floods, ping of death, source routing and port scans. If the incoming information flow is not blocked by the inspection for IPS anomalies, it is next processed against the firewall policy rules and authentication requirements. If the incoming information flow is allowed by the firewall policy rules (using the first match algorithm) and if any required authentication has been completed successfully, the incoming information flow may be subject to additional restrictions based on any Protection Profile which is associated with the firewall policy rule which allowed the information flow. Protection Profiles are used to define additional information flow restrictions which may be based on any or all of the following types of information:

- Scheduling
- SMTP commands
- SMTP Multi-Purpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) types
- FTP subcommands
- HTTP request methods
- Virus signatures
- IPS signature matching

Only an authorized administrator may create, modify or delete a Protection Profile. Additionally, only an authorized administrator may associate a Protection Profile with a firewall policy rule. If the request is an HTTP or HTTPS, the URL may be checked against the FortiGuard Web Filtering Policy. FortiGuard Web Filtering is made up of an external service which provides category, category group and classification information for any requested website, and an internal policy that applies that information. When FortiGuard Web Filter is enabled in a web filter profile, the setting is applied to all

5 Modular Exponential

firewall policies that use this profile. When a request for a web page appears in traffic controlled by one of these firewall policies, the URL is sent to the nearest FortiGuard server. The URL category is returned. If the category is blocked, the TOE provides a replacement message in place of the requested page. If the category is not blocked, the page request is sent to the requested URL as normal. The specific steps used by the TOE to process incoming information flows and enforce its security policy are summarized below:

1. Local IPS Anomaly protection (kernel level);
2. Firewall flow control policy enforcement: First matched policy must explicitly allow traffic to flow;
3. Authenticated flow control policies: If configured for flow-control policy, successful authentication is required for traffic to flow; and
4. Protection Profile services (if explicitly enabled):
- a. Scheduling: If scheduling is enabled, time period must be explicitly allowed,
- b. SMTP Commands: All SMTP commands permitted unless explicitly denied,
- c. MIME Types: All MIME types permitted unless explicitly denied,
- d. FTP Sub-Commands: All FTP sub-commands permitted unless explicitly denied,
- e. HTTP Request Methods: All HTTP request methods permitted unless explicitly denied,
- f. FortiGuard Web Filter: All URL requests are checked against the web filter policy to determine if they are allowed or blocked.
- g. Virus protection: If content is matched against an Anti-Virus (AV) signature, the configured action is performed, and
- h. IPS Signature matching: If the nature of the connection or content is matched against an IPS signature, the configured action is performed.

It must be noted that traffic is only passed to the next enforcement method if previous enforcement methods explicitly allow the traffic. After all security policy enforcement is performed and no further security scrutiny is required, the packet data is forwarded to the network host as determined by the configuration of the egress interface and/or static route. Additionally, an authorized administrator may set a maximum quota for the amount of data received by a subject (source or destination) in a specified period of time. If a maximum quota has been set by an authorized administrator, this quota will be enforced by the TOE.

## Identification and Authentication 7.1.4

In order to protect the TOE data and services, the TOE requires identification and authentication for all administrative access and network user access to specific services. The TOE maintains identity, role/authorization and authentication data to support this functionality. Identification and authentication is always enforced on the serial interface (local console). On the network interfaces identification and authentication is enforced for all administrator access, specific services, and VPN users. For local administrators, the identification and authentication mechanism is a username and password combination; for remote administration and user access to Telnet and FTP protocols, a FortiToken one-time password generator is required for authentication. Proxy users and administrators are presented with a system screen (configurable by an authorized administrator) prior to authentication, and must access this screen and authenticate prior to access. VPN peers authenticate using preshared keys or certificates for IPsec VPNs and certificates for SSL VPNs. The accounts are created by an authorized administrator over the serial or network interfaces. The account of an administrative user or IT entity is disabled after a configurable number of unsuccessful authentication attempts. An authorized administrator must take action to re-enable the account before authentication may take place. TOE Security Functional Requirements addressed: FIA\_AFL.1, FIA\_ATD.1,

## FIA\_UAU.2, FIA\_UAU.4, FIA\_UAU.5, FIA\_UID.2.

## Security Management 7.1.5

Appropriately authorized administrators may read audit log data, acknowledge alarms and manage users, IPS policies and information flow policies. The TOE immediately enforces the revocation of a user from an administrative access profile. The TOE provides a web-based GUI and a CLI to manage all of the security functions. The TOE allows both local and remote administration. Local administration is performed using the Local Console. Remote administration is performed using the Network web-based GUI. An administrator account consists of an administrator's identification and authentication information, and access profile. The access profile is a set of permissions that determine which functions the administrator is allowed to access. (The term 'role' is used in FMT\_SMR.1; however, the TOE uses the term access profile in its administration.) For any function, a profile may allow either read only or read-write access. When an administrator has read-only access to a feature, the administrator can access the web-based manager page for that feature but cannot make changes to the configuration. Similar permissions are enforced for the CLI. Each FortiGate unit (and the virtual model) comes with a default administrator account with all permissions, which may not be deleted. The term 'authorized administrator' is used throughout this ST to describe an administrator given the appropriate permission to perform tasks as required.

## FMT\_MSA.1(2), FMT\_MSA.1(3), FMT\_MSA.1(4), FMT\_SMF.1, FMT\_SMR.1.

## Protection of the TSF 7.1.6

The HA feature provides failover protection capability which includes configuration synchronization. The FortiGate units that make up the HA cluster exchange configuration information using a proprietary protocol (FortiGate Clustering Protocol (FGCP)). Before any information is exchanged, members of a HA cluster authenticate using information built into the FortiGate unit at the time of manufacture. Configuration information is exchanged every time the configuration of the master node in a HA cluster is updated. In this way, the slave or passive nodes in a cluster are prepared to assume the role of master node should the master node fail. Time is provided by the TSF and can only be changed by an authorized administrator. The TOE hardware devices include a hardware clock which is used to generate reliable time stamps which in turn are used for audit records and to provide scheduling features for flow control policies. The hardware clock does not rely upon any external factors in order to function correctly. The time setting of the hardware clock may only be modified by an authorized administrator and all such modifications are recorded in the audit log. For the virtual device, time information is provided to the TOE from the underlying hardware.

## TOE Security Functional Requirements addressed:

## Trusted Path/Channel 7.1.7

The TOE provides trusted paths and trusted channels, protected by encryption to guard against disclosure and protected by cryptographic signature to detect modifications. The trusted paths and trusted channels are logically distinct from other communication paths and provide assured identification of their end points. The trusted paths are used to protect remote administrator authentication, all remote administrator actions, Proxy User authentication, VPN user authentication, and all VPN user actions. Remote administration sessions apply to the Network Web-Based GUI. The Network Web-Based GUI uses the HTTPS protocol for secure administrator communications. With respect to the TOE implementation of HTTPS, TLS version 1.1 (RFC4346) and TLS 1.2 (RFC 5246) are used to encrypt and authenticate administration sessions between the remote browser and TOE. The TOE supports the following ciphersuites: TLS\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA (RFC 4346) TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA (RFC 5246) TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_128\_CBC\_SHA256 (RFC 5246) TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA (RFC 4346, RFC 5246) TLS\_DHE\_RSA\_WITH\_AES\_256\_CBC\_SHA256 (RFC 4346, RFC 5246) Use of these ciphersuites requires that the keying material be determined when the session is established through a Diffie-Hellman (DH) exchange which consists of the following steps:

- The server sends the 2048-bit RSA public certificate

## FPT\_FLS.1, FPT\_STM.1.

- The server generates, signs (RSA PKCS#1) and sends DH parameters and the DH public value
- The client generates and sends the DH public value. The keying material is then used to encrypt/decrypt (using AES128 or AES256) and authenticate (using HMAC-SHA1 or HMAC-SHA256) the data exchange.

By default, HTTPS connections to the TOE are disabled and must be explicitly enabled before an administrator may use the Network Web-Based GUI. SHA1 is supported in order to maintain compatibility with older browser versions, and compliance with RFC 4346 and RFC 5246. When a connection is first established, the server presents the 2048-bit RSA certificate to the connecting web browser. The administrator can examine the certificate to validate the identity of the TOE and then choose to continue with the connection if the certificate conforms to the expected values. Only after the certificate has been explicitly accepted as valid will the administrator be presented with the login page, where the user and password credentials can be submitted for authentication. Only local administrator account credentials can be used to successfully authenticate to the TOE via the Network Web-Based GUI. The trusted channels provide communication between the TOE and other TOE devices in support of the HA cluster configuration, when implemented. This channel is logically distinct from other communication channels and provides assured identification of the end points and protection of the channel data from disclosure. HA heartbeat encryption and authentication is enabled to encrypt and authenticate HA heartbeat packets. This ensures that the cluster password and changes to the cluster configuration are not exposed allowing an attacker to sniff HA packets to get cluster information. Enabling HA heartbeat message authentication prevents an attacker from creating false HA heartbeat messages. False HA heartbeat messages could affect the stability of the cluster. HA heartbeat encryption and authentication are disabled by default, and must be enabled in the evaluated configuration. HA authentication and encryption uses AES-128 for encryption and SHA-1 for authentication.

## TOE Security Functional Requirements addressed:

## Intrusion Prevention 7.1.8

The TOE provides an Intrusion Prevention System that examines network traffic arriving on its interfaces for evidence of intrusion attempts. Ingress packets received on a FortiGate interface are passed to the Denial of Service sensors, which determine if it is a valid information request or not. Detection of any potential attack is recorded in the IPS or packet logs. If the packet is allowed to pass based on the information flow policy (based on the Fortinet Protection Profile), it is examined against IPS signatures known to indicate potential attacks. If evidence of an attack is found, the TOE records the event in the IPS or packet logs. These logs are made available only to authorized administrators, and is provided in a manner suitable for the administrators to interpret the information.

## TOE Security Functional Requirements addressed: FIP\_DOS\_EXT.1, FIP\_SIG\_EXT.1.

## FTP\_ITC.1 and FTP\_TRP.1

## Anti-Virus Actions 7.1.9

The TOE detects and prevents virus attacks contained within information flows which arrive at any of its network interfaces. An authorized administrator may configure the TOE to block and or quarantine a virus which is detected in an information flow. The TOE may also be configured to monitor the information flow and make a record of any virus found, but perform no other action. The TOE provides a secure mechanism for the update of virus signatures used by the TSF.
