## A-Z Glossary of Blockchain Terms

Bitcoin: A  cryptocurrency,  the  first  and  most  renowned  application  (use  case)  of  blockchain  technology, specifically within financial services.

Blockchain: A tamper-proof, shared digital ledger that records transactions in a decentralized peer-to-peer network. The permanent recording of transactions in the blockchain permanently stores the history of asset exchanges between the peers (participants) in the network.

CBDC: A Central Bank Digital Currency is a form of digital money, issued by a central bank.

Centralization: When a single  entity,  such  as  a  bank  or  land  registry,  maintains  control  over  transaction records and data.

Consensus Mechanism: A consensus mechanism is a way to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or systems. In the context of blockchain, it's a set of rules or protocols that decide on the validity of the information added to the ledger.

Consortium Blockchain: It is used by organizations to enable private transactions among a circle of trusted participants, often spanning different corporate entities and geographical locations.

Cryptography: A set of techniques and algorithms that ensure the security and integrity of data stored and transmitted  on  a  blockchain  network.  Cryptography  plays  a  crucial  role  in  maintaining  the  decentralized, transparent, and tamper-proof nature of blockchain systems.

Decentralization: Eliminates the need for gatekeepers and the vulnerabilities of single points of failure

DeFi: Decentralized Finance

Digital Signatures: Digital signatures are used to authenticate valid transactions.

dPoS: Delegated  Proof  of  Stake,  a  type  of  consensus  mechanism  that  is  a  democratic  version  of  PoS. Stakeholders vote for a few delegates who manage the blockchain on their behalf.

Hash  Function: A  mathematical  function  commonly  used  to  verify  the  integrity  of  data,  by  transforming identical data to a unique, representative, fixed-size digest.

Hybrid Blockchain: It combines elements of both private and public blockchains. It attempts to use the best features of both worlds to cater to specific business needs.

Interoperability: The ability of blockchain networks to communicate with each other, sending and receiving messages, data, and tokens

Ledger: A ledger is a distributed, tamper-proof record, of all transactions that have ever taken place on the blockchain. It is a shared, synchronized database that is maintained by several computers (nodes). This means that no single entity has control over the ledger, and it is extremely difficult to alter or forge entries. The ledger is a crucial component of blockchain technology because it allows for secure and transparent transactions. Anyone with access to the ledger can view the entire history of transactions, which makes it impossible for any participant to cheat or double-spend. This transparency is essential for building trust in the system.

Virtual  Worlds  (Metaverse): The  product  of  a  technology-driven  shift  with  generalized  impact  through persistent and adaptable digital experiences.

Mining: The trust system in Bitcoin relies on computing power. Transactions are grouped into blocks, and it takes a lot of computing effort to prove (or "confirm") these blocks. However, once confirmed, they require only a little effort to verify as 'proven'. This validation process is known as mining. Mining generates new bitcoins in each block, in the same way that a central bank prints new money.

MiCA: Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) is a regulation in EU law, designed to bring clarity to the crypto-assets market. It is intended to help streamline distributed ledger technology (DLT) and virtual asset regulation in the EU whilst protecting users and investors. With MiCA, the EU has become the first leading jurisdiction globally to roll out a detailed regulation framework for the sector.

Nick Szabo: A computer scientist, who conceptualized 'bit gold', a decentralized digital currency that, although it was never realized, foreshadowed the structure of Bitcoin.

NFTs: Non-Fungible Token, is a type of digital asset distinct in its uniqueness and non-interchangeability with other digital tokens.

Node: A node is a device, typically a computer, which runs the blockchain's software and maintains a copy of the  blockchain's  transaction  history.  Nodes  are  responsible  for  validating  transactions,  ensuring  their authenticity  and  adherence  to  the  blockchain's  rules.  They  also  play  a  crucial  role  in  broadcasting  new transactions to the network and ensuring the integrity and consistency of the blockchain's data.

Permissioned Blockchain: In  permissioned  blockchains  not  anyone  can  join  the  network.  Permission  is provided to certain identifiable participants to join the network. They often have a level of privacy and control that is not present in permissionless systems. This can be particularly useful for consortia of businesses that wish to transact privately.

Permissionless Blockchain: In permissionless blockchains, there are no gatekeepers, and all transactions are public. This type of blockchain supports an environment where anyone can create an address and begin interacting with the network.

PoW: Proof  of  Work,  a  type  of  consensus  mechanism  used  by  Bitcoin,  where  miners  solve  complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks. The first one to solve the puzzle gets to add the block to the blockchain and is rewarded with cryptocurrency.

PoS: Proof of Stake, a type of consensus mechanism where participants 'stake' their cryptocurrency as a form of security. Validators are chosen to create a new block based on the amount they stake and other factors. It is more energy efficient than PoW.

PoA: Proof  of  Authority,  a  type  of  consensus  mechanism where transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators. It is faster and more energy-efficient but less decentralized.

Private Blockchain: Private blockchains are not open to the public and participation requires an invitation or permission. They provide more control over the participants and transactions.

Public Blockchain: Public blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereal are decentralized platforms that anyone can access and participate in. They are open for anyone to join, transact on, and participate in the consensus process.

Satoshi Nakamoto: A pseudonym for the individual or group of individuals that created Bitcoin in 2009.

## 1 Introduction to Blockchain

## 1.1 What is Blockchain: Definition and Basics

Centralization is a fundamental aspect of today's record-keeping systems, where a single entity, such as a bank or land registry, can control transaction records and data. This centralized structure is so ingrained in our societal  operations  that  it  often  goes  unquestioned,  managing  everything  from  financial  transactions  and property ownership to personal medical records and national IDs. However, reliance on a central authority raises concerns about trustworthiness, given the risks of corruption, hacking, and business failures. Central record-keepers also function as gatekeepers, deciding who can access and transact within these systems, thus wielding considerable power over participation and data accessibility.

In contrast, decentralized systems eliminate the need for gatekeepers and the vulnerabilities of single points of  failure.  Such  systems  offer  a  robust  alternative  by  allowing  parties  to  interact  peer-to-peer  without  an intermediary. Notable examples include the Internet, which enables global, decentralized communication, and blockchain networks like Bitcoin, which eases trustless financial transactions. These decentralized platforms demonstrate  the  potential  for  secure,  peer-to-peer  interactions,  even  among  parties  who  do  not  know  or inherently trust one another, marking a significant shift from the traditional, centralized paradigms.

The Internet fundamentally reshaped our world by creating a new foundational infrastructure that democratized the exchange of information. This shift led to two transformative processes: disintermediation, which phased out  players  that  failed  to  adapt,  and  cybermediation,  giving  rise  to  innovative  business  models  that  were previously inconceivable, like Instagram, Netflix, and Airbnb.

Similarly, blockchain is poised to revolutionize our world by democratizing the exchange of value and trust. While it may start with transitioning existing e-commerce to blockchain-enabled commerce, it can lead to the elimination  of  redundant  intermediaries  and  the  emergence  of  new  business  models  and  industries  that leverage the unique properties of blockchain.

In terms of what can be built on blockchain, there are native blockchain applications that couldn't have existed without this technology, promising exponential advancements, and the potential to disrupt existing industries significantly. As we stand on the cusp of this innovation wave, the full potential of blockchain applications is only beginning to be realized.

Blockchain  is  a  technology  that  has  the  potential  to  create  new  foundations  for  our  economic  and  social systems. It is a shared, immutable ledger (a complete record of a business's economic activities, usually used to keep track of the transfer of money and asset ownership) for recording the history of transactions. The technology is used to record transactions and track assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (like a house, car, cash, or land) or intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding).

A  blockchain  is  essentially  a  tamper-proof,  shared  digital  ledger  that  records  transactions  in  a decentralized peer-to-peer network. The permanent recording of transactions in the blockchain stores permanently the history of asset exchanges that take place between the peers (participants) in the network.

## 1.2 Historical Background

The  roots  of  blockchain  technology  go  back  much  further  than  its  current  link  to  digital  currencies.  The groundwork for blockchain was laid in the early '90s by researchers Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta. They

developed an early prototype for a system that would securely timestamp digital documents, preventing any possibility of backdating or alteration, effectively setting the stage for later blockchain frameworks. In 1998, a computer scientist, Nick Szabo conceptualized 'bit gold', a decentralized digital currency that, although never realized, foreshadowed the structure of Bitcoin.

It  wasn't  until  2009  that  blockchain  found  its  first  significant  application  with  the  creation  of  Bitcoin  by  the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was groundbreaking; it was the first technology to prevent the issue of double spending in a digital currency without relying on any central authority, due to its transparent and immutable ledger system.

In  the  years  following  Bitcoin's  debut,  blockchain  applications  have  proliferated  far  beyond  the  realm  of cryptocurrency.  Today,  it's  being  used  to  create  impenetrable  voting  systems,  enhance  supply  chain transparency,  and  even  verify  identities  and  property  ownership.  Through  this  evolution,  blockchain  has transitioned from an abstract idea to a transformative technology, fundamentally altering the landscape of digital transactions and data management.

## 1.3 Why Blockchain Matters: Key Advantages

Blockchain technology marks a transformative shift in the digital landscape, introducing a multitude of benefits that  highlight  its  importance.  Its  foremost  feature  is  its  decentralized  nature.  In  contrast  to  the  centralized governance  of  traditional  databases,  blockchain  spreads  its  data  across  a  vast  array  of  computers.  This distribution  fortifies  the  system  against  failures  and  attempts  at  centralized  manipulation,  ensuring that  no individual or group can wield unilateral power over the data, thereby making the process of data management more democratic and secure.

Additionally, the fundamental structure of blockchain promotes both transparency and an enduring record of data. Altering recorded data on a blockchain is highly challenging, providing a durable and trustworthy ledger of transactions that is critical for areas like financial services and supply chain operations, where the accuracy of  historical  records  is  non-negotiable.  This  transparency  gives  every  network  participant  equal  insight, fostering trust where it is often difficult to secure. The distinctive benefits offered by blockchain technology not only revolutionize safeguarding data and upholding its integrity but also open doors to groundbreaking uses across various sectors, including but not limited to finance and healthcare.

A summary of the key advantages of blockchain technology, demonstrating how blockchain can offer unique benefits over traditional centralized systems:

- Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Blockchain enables transactions directly between participants without the need for intermediaries, streamlining processes and potentially reducing costs.
- Distributed Network: The blockchain network consists of its participants, distributing data across multiple nodes, which enhances data integrity and resilience against failures or attacks.
- Reliability: The significant amount of replication in blockchain networks ensures a high degree of data accuracy and consistency.
- Censorship  Resistance: No  single  party  has  control  over  the  data  flow  in  a  blockchain,  making  it resistant to censorship and unilateral alterations.
- Public Verification: In many blockchains, transactions are publicly available and verifiable, promoting transparency.
- Open/Permissionless Access: Many  blockchain  networks  are  open,  allowing  anyone  to  participate, which fosters inclusivity and broadens access.

- Immutability: Once recorded, transactions on a blockchain may become permanent and unalterable, ensuring the longevity and unchangeability of records.

## 1.4 The case of Bitcoin

There is a common misconception that Bitcoin and blockchain are synonymous, but this is not the case. Bitcoin represents the first and most renowned application of blockchain technology, specifically within the realm of financial services.

Bitcoin's emergence mirrors a pattern of technological revolutions that Marc Andreessen eloquently described. Initially perceived as a mysterious novelty, Bitcoin, much like personal computers in 1975 and the Internet in 1993, was the culmination of two decades of rigorous research by nearly anonymous individuals. Initially met with scepticism by some and perceived as a tool for liberation by others, Bitcoin captivated technologists and innovators who recognized and nurtured its potential. Over time, it evolved into a technology with profound mainstream impact, leading many to retrospectively acknowledge its transformative promise.

The trust system in Bitcoin relies on computing power. Transactions are grouped into blocks, and it takes a lot of computing effort to prove (or "confirm") these blocks. However, once confirmed, they require only a little effort to verify as 'proven'. This validation process is known as mining.

Mining generates new bitcoins in each block, the same way that a central bank prints new money. The quantity of  new  bitcoins  created  is  predetermined  and  decreases  over  time.  Mining  builds  trust  by  ensuring  that transactions are only confirmed if a significant amount of computational work has been put into the block containing them. The more blocks added, the more computing work is required, which in turn strengthens the trust in the system.

'[...] Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate.'

Marc Andreessen, Why Bitcoin Matters, The New York Times, 2014

The evolution of Bitcoin, the first decentralized cryptocurrency, is a testament to the evolution of blockchain technology:

- 2008:  The  journey  began  with  the  registration  of  bitcoin.org  by  Satoshi  Nakamoto  and  Martti  Malmi. Nakamoto  released  the  seminal  Bitcoin  white  paper  later  that  year,  laying  the  foundation  for  a decentralized currency.
- 2009: Bitcoin officially came into existence as Nakamoto mined the first block, known as the genesis block, and released Bitcoin software. The first Bitcoin transaction occurred this year, marking a new era in digital transactions.
- 2010: Bitcoin's first commercial transaction took place, famously involving the purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. At that time, the value of those Bitcoins was about $41. This year also witnessed the launch of the first Bitcoin exchange and the start of pooled mining.
- 2011-2013: The Bitcoin Foundation was established. Bitcoin underwent its first halving, where the reward for  mining  a  new  block  was  halved  from  50  Bitcoins  per  block  to  25  Bitcoins  per  block.  The cryptocurrency's popularity surged, with significant growth in mining difficulty and market capitalization. The University of Nicosia became the first university in the world to accept Bitcoin for tuition payment.

Observatory and Forum

- 2014-2015: The Court of Justice of the European Union issued its first-ever ruling on Bitcoin, stating that it was indeed a currency and a means of payment, not a commodity or an asset (as some argued). Bitcoin was also exempt from VAT. Regulatory advancements included the issuance of the 'BitLicense' in New York. NASDAQ adopted blockchain technology for securities, reflecting growing mainstream interest.
- 2016-2017: The second halving event occurred where the reward for mining a block was halved from 25 to 12.5 Bitcoins. Bitcoin's value skyrocketed to nearly $20,000. Bitcoin Cash (BCH) emerged from a hard fork, as a result of debates and disagreements about how to scale Bitcoin.
- 2018-2019: Bitcoin experienced volatility, with notable endorsements and incidents such as the collapse of a major cryptocurrency exchange, emphasizing the importance of secure key management.
- 2020-2021: The third halving took place amidst economic uncertainty, with Bitcoin proving its resilience. Tesla's investment in Bitcoin and El Salvador's adoption of it as legal tender were major highlights. Bitcoin reached its all-time high of $69,000 in November 2021 before falling below $16,000 a year later.
- 2022-2023: The cryptocurrency's price dropped and then saw a resurgence, displaying both its volatility and enduring appeal.

As  the  most  prominent  application  of  blockchain  technology,  Bitcoin's  evolution  has  been  instrumental  in demonstrating blockchain's potential beyond a mere digital ledger. Tracing its roots from an innovative idea to a globally recognized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin exemplifies the transformative power of blockchain.

## 2 Understanding the Fundamentals

## 2.1 How does Blockchain work

## 2.1.1. Decentralization

Blockchain decentralization is a 'paradigm shift' from centralized systems. It distributes power and control across  a  network,  enhances  security,  and  promotes  transparency.  This  technology  has  far-reaching implications beyond cryptocurrencies, including supply chain, healthcare, and more, where trust and security are paramount.

The key concepts of decentralization include:

## Distributed Ledger

Traditional System: In a traditional,  centralized system, e.g., a bank, all records are stored in one place. If this central point fails or is attached, the entire system is compromised.

Blockchain System: In a blockchain, the ledger is spread across many computers - called 'nodes'. Each node has a full copy of the ledger, ensuring no single point of failure.

## Consensus Mechanism

Decision Making: Instead of a central authority (e.g., a bank manager), deciding on transactions to be made, in blockchain the transactions are agreed upon by consensus among the nodes.

Process:  When a new transaction is  made,  it  is  broadcast  to  the  entire  network.  The  nodes  verify  the transaction based on preset/pre-agreed rules and add it to their ledger copy if it is valid (approved).

## Security and Trust

Cryptography: Each block in the blockchain is secured using complex mathematical algorithms, making it extremely difficult to alter previously created records.

Trust:  As  every  node  has  the  same  version  of  the  ledger  and  follows  strict  rules  for  validation,  trust  is established -not through a central authority, but through the network's collective agreement.

## Transparency and Immutability

Transparency: every transaction on the (public) blockchain is visible to anyone who accesses it, promoting transparency.

Immutability: once a transaction is added to the blockchain, it is not possible to have it altered or deleted, thus ensuring the integrity of the ledger.

Figure 1: The Key concepts of decentralization

A practical example of how decentralization works on blockchain is Bitcoin (see previous section). Bitcoin is a digital currency built on blockchain. There is no central bank controlling it; instead, transactions are verified by a global network of nodes, making it decentralized.

## 2.1.2. Cryptography

To grasp what Cryptography entails, think of it as a tamper-proof seal on a jar. If the seal is broken (akin to the cryptographic rules being violated), the contents of the jar might have been tampered with. Just like how the seal protects the jar, cryptography protects the information on the blockchain.

When we discuss blockchain cryptography, this entails the following components:

Digital Signatures: the purpose of digital signatures is to ensure security and authenticity. To achieve this, when a user makes a transaction, they sign it with their private key (a secret code known only to them, also known as Privkey). Others can use the sender's public key (a code that everyone can see, also known as Pubkey) to verify that the transaction was indeed created by the rightful owner of the private key. Imagine the public key as something like a bank account number, and the private key as a secret PIN or a signature on a check, which gives you control over the account.

Hash Functions are used to maintain the integrity and the order of the blockchain. In practice, a hash function is like a digital fingerprint for data. It takes any input (like a block of transactions) and produces a fixed-size string of characters, which is unique to that specific input. Any small change in the input data changes this hash drastically. Each block in the blockchain contains the hash of the previous block, creating a secure link.

Blockchain Cryptography is important because it provides security using private keys, i.e., ensures that only the owner of the key can authorize transactions. It also provides integrity ,  as  the  hash  functions  make it extremely difficult to alter any information on the blockchain without being detected. As previously mentioned, we also get decentralization , as the same cryptographic rules apply to every copy of the blockchain, thus ensuring consistency across the network, without the need for a central authority.

It is still important to note that although blockchain cryptography is highly secure, it's not completely foolproof. It depends on the robustness of the algorithms used and the secrecy of the private keys.

## 2.1.3. Consensus Mechanisms

A consensus mechanism is a way to achieve agreement on a single data value among distributed processes or  systems.  In  the  context  of  blockchain,  it's  a  set  of  rules  or  protocols  that  decide  on  the  validity  of  the information added to the ledger. This is crucial because it ensures that all participants in the network agree on the current state of the ledger.

Types of Consensus Mechanisms:

## Proof of Work (PoW):

- Used by Bitcoin.
- Miners solve complex mathematical puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.
- The  first  one  to  solve  the  puzzle  gets  to  add  the  block  to  the  blockchain  and  is  rewarded  with cryptocurrency.
- Very secure but requires a lot of energy.

## Proof of Stake (PoS):

- Participants 'stake' their cryptocurrency as a form of security.
- Validators are chosen to create a new block based on the amount they stake and other factors.
- More energy efficient than PoW.

## Delegated Proof of Stake (dPoS):

- A democratic version of PoS.
- Stakeholders vote for a few delegates who manage the blockchain on their behalf.

## Proof of Authority (PoA):

- Transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators.
- Faster and more energy-efficient but less decentralized.

To better understand the concept of Consensus Mechanisms, picture a group of stakeholders who share a notebook. Each time one of the stakeholders wishes to add one note, they should follow specific rules:

- In PoW, they need to solve a difficult puzzle to earn the right to add the note.
- In PoS, they need to show they have a certain number of pages in the notebook (their stake) to be chosen randomly to add the note.
- In DPoS, everyone votes on a few people who will have the right to add notes.
- In PoA, only a few trusted people have the pen to write in the notebook.

Regardless of the type of the Consensus Mechanism, this ensures that everyone agrees on what is written and no one can cheat. The consensus mechanism makes sure that all the notes (transactions) are valid and agreed upon by everyone.

## 2.2 Blockchain vs Traditional Databases

## Traditional databases

When discussing traditional databases, we acknowledge that there is management and control over all the data  by  a  single  entity  or  organization.  Regarding  data  structure,  data  is  typically  stored  in  tables  or  in  a structured format, which can be easily modified or deleted by those with access. Access and security to the database are controlled by the administrator, and security is maintained through passwords, firewalls, and other security measures. In such databases, data can be easily added, modified, or deleted, while at the same time, it is not possible to trace the original data unless there are specific audit trails.

Traditional databases are used for storing, retrieving, and managing data in various applications like banking systems, inventory systems, websites, etc.

## Blockchain

Blockchain is a decentralized system that doesn't have a single point of control. Instead, it is maintained by a network of nodes (computers), each holding a copy of the ledger. The data is stored in blocks, and each block is connected to the previous one, forming a chain. This makes it extremely difficult to alter records. Every transaction taking place on the blockchain is transparent and can be seen by everyone in the network. The use of cryptographic techniques ensures that data is secure and tamper-proof. Once data (or a transaction) is added to the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted. This ensures a high level of data integrity and trust.

Blockchain is widely used for cryptocurrency transactions like Bitcoin and Ether. Still, there are several other uses, in areas like supply chain management, voting systems, and anywhere where transparency and security are crucial.

## Key Differences in Simple Terms

Control: Traditional databases are like a personal diary kept and managed by one person. Blockchain is like a shared ledger where entries made by anyone are visible to everyone and cannot be erased.

Security: Think  of  traditional  databases  as  a  bank  vault  that  is  secure  but  managed  by  the  bank  itself. Blockchain is like a transparent safe where everyone can see what's inside, but no one can change or remove anything once it's put in.

Data  Modification: In  a  traditional  database,  you  can  easily  change  past  entries  (like  editing  a  Word document). In blockchain, once something is written, it's more like writing in pen on a piece of paper - it cannot be erased.

For selecting the technology that would best serve the user needs or application, it is essential to understand the above differences.

## When to Use Blockchain

<!-- image -->

<!-- image -->

As elaborated in the previous sections, Blockchain and traditional databases serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics; therefore, the selection between them depends on the specific requirements of your application.

Blockchain would be a better option for the following cases:

- Immutable and tamper-proof records: Blockchain is designed to provide an immutable and tamperproof ledger. If your application requires a trustless and transparent record-keeping system where data once written cannot be altered, blockchain is a better choice.
- Decentralization and trustlessness: If you need a system that operates without a central authority or intermediary,  blockchain's  decentralized  nature  can  be  advantageous.  It  allows  multiple  parties  to participate in a network without relying on a central entity to maintain and validate data.
- Transparency and auditability: Blockchains are transparent, and every transaction or change to the data  is  recorded  in  a  public  ledger.  This  transparency  can  be  crucial  in  industries  like  supply  chain management, where stakeholders want to trace the origins of products or verify the authenticity of records.
- Smart contracts: Blockchain platforms like Ethereum enable the use of smart contracts, self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions. If your application relies on automation and trust in contract execution, blockchain-based smart contracts can be valuable.
- Cryptographic security: Blockchain technology leverages cryptographic techniques for securing data and transactions. This can be advantageous when dealing with sensitive information or  when strong security guarantees are required.
- Cross-organizational trust: In situations where multiple organizations or parties need to collaborate and share data while maintaining trust, a blockchain can be a suitable solution. It ensures that all participants have equal access to the same data and can independently verify its integrity.
- Cryptocurrency  or  token  management :  If  your  application  involves  managing  digital  assets  like cryptocurrencies  or  tokens,  blockchain  is  essential  as  it  provides  the  infrastructure  needed  for  their creation, transfer, and security.
- Use cases requiring consensus: In applications where achieving consensus among multiple parties is crucial, blockchain's consensus algorithms can be beneficial. These algorithms ensure that all participants agree on the state of the system.

Blockchain may be a useful technology, but it is important to bear in mind the limitations, including scalability, performance, and cost considerations. Traditional databases may be more suitable for applications that require high-speed data processing, and low latency, or do not require the features provided by blockchain. In certain cases, there is also a possibility for a hybrid approach, combining both technologies to leverage the strengths provided by each of them.

## 3 Types of Blockchain

Blockchains  have  transcended  their  initial  role  as  platforms  for  peer-to-peer  payments,  expanding  into  a diverse ecosystem that supports a wide range of organizational functions. This evolution has transformed them from a simple 'internet of money' to a robust 'internet of value.' Beyond the well-known open, public, and permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum, there exists a variety of blockchains including public, private,  permissioned,  permissionless,  and  hybrid  models.  Each  type  is  designed  to  fulfill  specific  needs, adhere to rules, and utilise distinct protocols, offering a spectrum of advantages and challenges tailored to various use cases.

Figure 2: Four main types of blockchain technology

<!-- image -->

## 3.1 Public vs Private Blockchains

Public  blockchains are  decentralized  platforms  that  anyone  can  access  and  participate  in.  Unlike  private blockchains that are restricted and often managed by single organizations, public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are open for anyone to join, transact on, and participate in the consensus process. This openness, however, comes with trade-offs in terms of scalability and privacy. Private blockchains , on the other hand, are not open to the public and participation requires an invitation or permission. These blockchains provide more control over the participants and transactions, which can be beneficial for businesses with privacy concerns or for those needing to comply with specific regulatory standards.

## 3.2 Permissionless vs Permissioned Blockchains

In permissionless  blockchains ,  there  are  no  gatekeepers,  and  all  transactions  are  public.  This  type  of blockchain  supports  an  environment  where  anyone  can  create  an  address  and  begin  interacting  with  the network. Permissionless blockchains are generally public, though not all public blockchains are necessarily permissionless.  In  public  and  permissionless  blockchains  any  individual  has  the  liberty  to  join  or  exit  the network, partake in transaction validation, or engage in the mining process. Participants can independently maintain a full copy of the blockchain, ensuring total transparency and public verification of all transactions. These networks avoid the conventional barriers  of  credentials  or  identity  verifications,  allowing  anyone  to become a part of the network simply by downloading the necessary software. In such an ecosystem, the trust is placed in the blockchain protocol itself rather than in any individual operator, fostering a truly decentralized environment. The most well-known examples of public and permissionless blockchains include Bitcoin (2009) and Ethereum (2015). These public and permissionless networks have their own native currency/asset: bitcoin for the Bitcoin blockchain, and ether for the Ethereum blockchain.

<!-- image -->

In permissioned blockchains not anyone can join the network. Permission is provided to certain identifiable participants  to  join  the  network.  They  often  have  a  level  of  privacy  and  control  that  is  not  present  in permissionless  systems.  This  can  be  particularly  useful  for  consortia  of  businesses  that  wish  to  transact privately. They designate who is authorized to operate a node, validate new transactions, and gain access to, or exert influence over, various segments of the blockchain. Additionally, these blockchains restrict the ability to  implement  changes  to  the  system,  ensuring  that  only  approved  individuals  or  entities  can  modify  the protocol. Two well-known examples of Permissioned blockchain are Hyperledger Fabric and Ripple.

## 3.3 Consortium Blockchains

Consortium blockchains are used by organizations to enable private transactions among a circle of trusted participants, often spanning different corporate entities and geographical locations. Notable examples include R3  Corda  and  Quorum.  The  Enterprise  Ethereum  Alliance  furthers  this  concept  by  working  towards  a standardized Ethereum-based framework tailored for varied enterprise applications like finance and supply chain, boasting a robust membership of over 450 businesses, including prominent names like Microsoft and Intel.

## 3.4 Hybrid Blockchains

Hybrid blockchains combine elements of both private and public blockchains. They attempt to use the best features of both worlds to cater to specific business needs. For example, a hybrid blockchain might allow control over who can participate in the blockchain network while still allowing certain transactions to be visible on a public blockchain system. These hybrid systems are not as open as public blockchains but offer more transparency than private blockchains. This type of blockchain is particularly appealing to businesses that require transaction privacy but still need to maintain a level of transparency with regulators or the public. Some well-known examples of hybrid blockchains are Dragonchain and Kadena.

## 4 Blockchain Use Cases

## 4.1 Finance and Cryptocurrency

Finance  is  a  broad  field  that  deals  with  managing  money,  investments,  and  financial  resources.  It encompasses various activities and concepts, including personal finance, investing, banking, insurance and financial markets.

- Personal finance involves managing one's own money, budgeting, saving, and making financial decisions to achieve financial goals. It includes concepts like saving for retirement, paying off debt, and creating an emergency fund.
- Investing involves using money to buy assets like stocks, bonds, real estate, or mutual funds with the expectation  of  earning  a  profit.  Investors  typically  aim  to  grow  their  wealth  over  time  through  smart investment choices.
- Banking services include opening and managing bank accounts, using credit cards, and accessing loans. Banks provide a safe place to store money, facilitate transactions, and offer various financial products and services.
- Insurance protects individuals and businesses against financial losses due to unexpected events, such as  accidents,  illnesses,  or  disasters.  Common  types  of  insurance  include  health  insurance,  auto insurance, and home insurance.

<!-- image -->

- Financial  markets  are  platforms  where  various  financial  instruments  are  bought  and  sold.  Stock exchanges, bond markets, and commodity markets are examples. They play a crucial role in the global economy.

Cryptocurrency is a relatively new and quite disruptive development within the financial world. It is a type of digital  or  virtual  currency  that  uses  cryptography  for  security.  Some  of  the  main  characteristics  of cryptocurrencies are:

- Cryptocurrencies exist only in digital form, and they are not physically tangible like traditional money (e.g., cash or coins). They are stored in digital wallets, which can be software-based or hardware-based.
- They operate on blockchain technology, which is a decentralized and distributed ledger (see previous sections for details). This technology ensures transparency, security, and immutability of transactions.
- Contrary  to  what  we  know  about  traditional  currencies  controlled  by  governments  and  central  banks, cryptocurrencies are decentralized. This means that there is no single entity that has control over the currency, and transactions are verified by a network of participants (nodes).
- Some cryptocurrencies, like  Bitcoin, use a process called mining to validate and add transactions to the blockchain. Miners use powerful computers to solve complex mathematical puzzles, and in return, they are rewarded with new cryptocurrency coins (see previous sections for details).
- Cryptocurrencies can be used for various purposes, including online purchases, and investment, as well as a means of  transferring  value  across  borders  quickly  and  with  lower  fees  compared  to  traditional  banking methods.
- Cryptocurrency prices can be highly volatile, with significant fluctuations in value over short periods. This presents both opportunities and risks for investors and users.

Finance and cryptocurrency share a connection while also maintaining their  identities  within  the  realm  of monetary matters and investment. They each present a range of prospects and hurdles.

## 4.2 Supply Chain Management

We meet blockchain technology as part of the supply chain management process more and more these days, especially as the technology is key for enhancing transparency, traceability, and security throughout the entire supply chain.

Blockchain allows for the creation of a tamper-proof, immutable ledger that records every transaction or event in the supply chain. This enables end-to-end visibility , making it easier to track the origin , production, and movement of products. This is particularly useful for industries where traceability is critical, such as in the food and pharmaceutical industries.

Through  blockchain,  companies  can  ensure  the authenticity of  products  and  components.  Products  are assigned unique digital identifiers (e.g., a serial number or QR code) that are recorded on the blockchain. Consumers and other involved stakeholders can verify the authenticity of a product by scanning the code.

Smart contracts  are self-executing agreements with  the  terms  of the contract  written into  code. In supply chains, smart contracts can automate various processes such as payment, quality control, and delivery when predefined conditions are met, thus reducing the need for intermediaries. In addition, the transparency and security of blockchain can help in decreasing counterfeiting allowing both companies and consumers to verify the authenticity of products at any point in the supply chain.

<!-- image -->

Other benefits of blockchain include:

- the  optimization  of  inventory  levels  and  the  facilitation  of  supply-chain  financing,  through  real-time  data monitoring of goods.
- Data recorded on the blockchain can also include information about the products and materials' quality, thus ensuring that only high-quality resources are used in manufacturing, reducing defects and potential recalls. This is essential for industries that need to comply with strict regulatory requirements.
- Tracking of environmental and sustainability performance and impact through supply chain operations, i.e., carbon emissions, water usage, etc.
- Management  and  verification  of  suppliers'  performance  and  credentials/  qualifications.  This  is  useful  for making responsible selection of ethical and reliable partners.

## 4.3 Healthcare

Blockchain technology is currently used by the healthcare industry in various applications, from sharing clinical trial data to managing patients' records. Some of the most common and highly effective applications include:

Electronic Health Records (EHRs) are both secure and interoperable, providing a secure and standardized way to  store  and  share  electronic  health  records,  ensuring  that  patient  data  is  both  protected  and  easily accessible to any authorized parties. This allows patients to have more control over who can access their health and insurance data.

Medical  data  sharing ,  for  example,  research  and  clinical  trials  results  can  be  shared  in  a  secure  and transparent manner. Data is anonymised but both integrity and patient privacy are secured.

Medical supply chain management, i.e., drug traceability for the entire pharmaceuticals supply chain is made possible, by ensuring authenticity and quality of drugs, reducing counterfeits, and improving safety.

Patient consent management is maintained through smart contracts on a blockchain, allowing patients to have better control of their data and how they are used.

Telemedicine and  remote  monitoring  through secure  communication ,  facilitated  by  blockchain.  The technology  can  ensure  secure  and  private  communication  between  healthcare  providers  and  patients  in telemedicine consultations and remote monitoring.

Management of healthcare providers' credentials . Blockchain can store and verify credentials of healthcare professionals, ensuring that practitioners have all necessary qualifications.

Processing of health insurance claims through blockchain, to help streamline and automate verification, reducing fraud.

Authentication of drug prescriptions for both patients and healthcare providers, by checking the origin and supply chain on a blockchain.

Patient-managed health records , giving them control over their medical history and allowing them to share with any healthcare providers as needed.

Encryption and access control to help enhance data security of patient information and to allow granular access control, thus reducing the risk of data breaches.

Access to a diverse range of healthcare data on a blockchain for population health studies and analytics for research and analysis purposes, while respecting privacy and security concerns.

## 4.4 Voting and Governance

As discussed in the use cases presented earlier, blockchain is used for enhancing transparency, security, and efficiency. Blockchain can be used for

## · Secure Voting Systems to:

- o securely verify the identity of voters, reducing the risk of fraudulent votes.
- o record votes in an immutable and tamper-resistant manner, ensuring the integrity of the voting process.
- o enhance transparency and auditability for the entire voting process, including the counting of votes.
- Secure and verifiable remote voting , i.e., enabling people to vote from the comfort of their homes or remote locations.
- Proxy voting for  shareholders  in  corporations  or  members  of  organizations  to  securely  cast  their  votes, reducing the need for intermediaries.
- Creating  Decentralized  Autonomous  Organisations  (DAOs), i.e.,  self-governing  entities  that  make decisions through smart contracts and voting mechanisms encoded on the blockchain.
- Maintaining transparent and tamper-proof records of decisions, pieces of legislation or regulations, and government processes.
- Verifying the identities of individuals participating in voting and governance activities, reducing the risk of identity fraud.
- Token-based voting , i.e., allowing stakeholders to vote in proportion to their holdings (tokens), as seen in some blockchain-based governance models.
- Enabling decentralized decision-making, where participants have a say in governance decisions without relying on centralized authorities.
- Performing immutable audits of voting and governance processes, ensuring compliance and transparency.
- Enhancing the security of voting and governance systems, as the immutability and decentralized nature of blockchain makes it resistant to hacking or manipulation.

## 4.5 Intellectual Property

Blockchain is currently used in Intellectual Property management in a number of ways:

- Blockchain can be used to establish and verify the ownership and origin of digital assets such as creative works, patents, trademarks, and digital media. Each IP asset can be recorded on the blockchain with a timestamp, creating an immutable and transparent record of its creation and ownership history.
- Content creators can timestamp their work on a blockchain, providing indisputable evidence of the creation date. This can be used to establish copyright and prove ownership in case of disputes.
- In IP management, smart contracts can automate royalty payments, licensing agreements, and other contractual obligations. For instance, when a piece of content is used, the blockchain can automatically trigger the payment of royalties to the creator.
- Blockchain can streamline the process of licensing IP assets . Smart contracts can enforce the terms of licensing agreements, ensuring that royalties are automatically and fairly distributed to creators and rightsholders based on predefined conditions and usage data.
- For physical products, blockchain can be used to create digital certificates of authenticity . This helps in preventing counterfeit goods and ensuring that consumers are purchasing genuine products with the associated IP rights.

- In industries like fashion and luxury goods, blockchain can track the entire supply chain of products , from creation to distribution. This helps in ensuring the authenticity of products and helps in identifying and addressing IP infringements.
- Managing patent information , including filing, prosecution, and maintenance, can be made more efficient using blockchain technology. This can help inventors and organizations keep a secure and transparent record of their patents.
- Blockchain can facilitate decentralized marketplaces for buying and selling IP rights , making it easier for creators and companies to monetize their intellectual property directly with others without the need for intermediaries.
- Blockchain's cryptographic and decentralized nature enhances the security and protection of sensitive IP data , reducing the risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.
- The transparency of blockchain allows for easy auditing of IP transactions and rights . This can help organizations and creators ensure that their IP assets are being used in compliance with agreements.

## 5 Emerging Topics in Blockchain

## 5.1 NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)

An  NFT,  short  for  Non-Fungible  Token,  is  a  type  of  digital  asset  distinct  in  its  uniqueness  and  noninterchangeability with other digital tokens. Unlike fungible tokens, each NFT is cryptographically verified for its singularity and stored on a blockchain or distributed ledger, visible to all. While this isn't always the case, NFTs represent more than just digital records of an asset; they are unique digital assets. This concept is akin to how blockchain technology has enabled the creation of an' internet of value'.

The history of NFTs has evolved from basic digital collectibles to complex asset ownership models. Originating with "colored coins" on the Bitcoin network in 2012, these early NFTs added specific utility to Bitcoins. The first major  NFT  project,  CryptoPunks,  launched  in  mid-2017  on  Ethereum,  featuring  10,000  unique  digital characters. CryptoKitties soon followed, popularizing NFTs with a game that allowed users to breed digital cats. Today, NFTs have expanded into the realms of art, sports, and music, with platforms like SuperRare and OpenSea facilitating the trading and creation of a wide range of digital assets. Ethereum's ERC-721 is the most popular blockchain for NFTs and it serves as the basis for determining specific characteristics of NFTs:

- Uniqueness: NFTs  are  individually  identifiable,  with  a  limited  number  issued,  like  the  10,000  unique CryptoPunks.
- Rarity: NFT rarity takes various forms:
- o Artificial Rarity: Determined by code or specifics of issuance, like CryptoPunks' rare traits.
- o Numerical Rarity: Linked to limited issuance, like a limited number of digital art pieces.
- o Historical Rarity: Based on the NFT's historical significance or past ownership.
- Ownership: NFTs provide proof of ownership, potential for fractional ownership, and provenance tracking, especially for assets tied to the real world.
- Immutability: NFTs on blockchain are resistant to tampering, ensuring trust and transparency.
- Programmability: NFTs can be programmed for various purposes, including ensuring ongoing artist royalties or use as collateral in decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

The European Union Blockchain Observatory &amp; Forum (EUBOF) Demystifying Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) report provides an in-depth explanation of how NFTs work.

## 5.2 DeFi (Decentralized Finance)

To grasp the essence of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), it's crucial to first explore its counterpart in the financial world: Traditional Finance, or TradFi. The term 'TradFi' refers to the conventional financial services industry, covering a broad spectrum of activities like money management, credit, banking, and investment. At the heart of  TradFi  are  centralized  institutions,  often  termed  as  CeFi  (Centralized  Finance),  which  function  as intermediaries in various financial transactions. This sector is typified by two primary characteristics: a custodial approach where assets are entrusted to CeFi entities for management and safekeeping, and a permissioned nature requiring verified identity for participation. Despite its long-standing role in economic growth, TradFi has significant  drawbacks.  Financial  exclusion  remains  a  major  issue,  with  approximately  1.7  billion  people worldwide lacking access to a bank account. This scenario is prevalent even in developed regions, including Europe and the United States. Additionally, TradFi is plagued by high transaction costs and slow processing times, particularly in remittances, currency manipulation, capital controls, lack of transparency, and systemic risks like financial crises and bank runs.

In contrast, DeFi represents a paradigm shift. Operating on decentralized, open, and peer-to-peer models through  smart  contracts  on  blockchains,  DeFi  bypasses  traditional  intermediaries.  It's  not  just  a  fintech evolution but a radical reimagining of financial services, offering lending, borrowing, and trading of assets in a P2P manner. DeFi can not only replicate traditional financial services but also foster novel business models unfeasible in the realm of TradFi.

Figure 3: Functional differences of TradFi and DeFi (Source: EUBOF DeFi report)

DeFi,  running  on  public  blockchains,  is  distinguished  from  the  private  networks  of  TradFi  by  several  key features. It is open, permissionless, and resistant to censorship, allowing anyone to participate without identity verification or authorization, and preventing any single entity from blocking valid transactions. DeFi operates on  a  peer-to-peer  basis,  eliminating  the  need  for  intermediaries.  Its  decentralized  nature  means  multiple independent network participants validate transactions, ensuring enhanced security and reliability.

Additionally, DeFi is characterized by its public, verifiable transactions, immutable transaction history, and lack of geographical constraints, making it a truly global financial solution.

DeFi, while offering revolutionary financial services, carries inherent risks. These include technology risks, such as failures in the DeFi protocols due to issues with their technological infrastructure. Project risks are also prevalent, originating from the unique characteristics of each DeFi application while economic and governance risks arise from the management styles of these apps. DeFi has seen considerable growth, yet it still is an emerging field marked by distinct risks and a regulatory landscape that is still developing.

The European Union Blockchain Observatory &amp; Forum (EUBOF) Decentralized Finance (DeFi) report provides an in-depth explanation of DeFi.

## 5.3 Virtual Worlds

Defining Virtual Worlds (or Metaverse) is challenging; hence, a lot of different definitions exist.

-  'The metaverse seems to be whatever people's imaginations dream it to be.' - McKinsey
-  'It's partly a dream for the future of the internet.' - The Verge
-  'A seamless convergence of our physical and digital lives' - Onyx, JP Morgan
-  'A  massively scaled  and interoperable  network of real-time rendered  3D virtual worlds which can be experienced synchronously and persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with continuity of data' - Matthew Ball
-  'But  the  metaverse  is  not  3D  or  2D,  or  even  necessarily  graphical;  it  is  about  the  inexorable dematerialization of physical space, distance, and objects.' -Jon Radoff
-  'The metaverse is the moment in time where our digital life is worth more than our physical life.' -Shaan Puri

The European Commission (EC) has recently  provided a concrete definition on the metaverse - or virtual world as it is now widely referred to:

'Virtual  worlds are  persistent,  immersive  environments,  based  on  technologies  including  3D  and  extended reality (XR), which make it possible to blend physical and digital worlds in real-time, for a variety of purposes such  as  designing,  making  simulations,  collaborating,  learning,  socializing,  carrying  out  transactions  or providing entertainment.'

In  a  report  published  in  2022,  the  EU  Blockchain  Observatory  and  Forum  defined  the  Virtual  Worlds (Metaverse) as 'the product of a technology-driven shift with generalized impact through persistent and adaptable digital experiences.'

According to the EUBOF report,, 'it is still too early to draw definitive conclusions on the desirable, let alone the commercially successful or the socially optimal characteristics of metaverses. Even the very definition of the term we have offered, as well as similar definitions found in the scientific or business literatures, cannot be considered definitive - the technology, its applications, and its use cases are rudimentary and are still evolving. Attempting to conclude the metaverse today is as risky as it would have been in the early 1990s to attempt to predict the future path of the internet'.

The essence of the definitions mentioned above, highlights several core themes. Firstly, there's a broad and profound transition occurring across various norms, fields, and  cultural divides, which is opening unprecedented  opportunities.  Secondly,  the  creation  of  continuous,  unified,  and  collective  experiences  is fostering the  emergence of what feels like a new 'world.' Lastly, while  Virtual Worlds offer  immersive and

interactive  environments,  they  also  accommodate  more  restrained  forms  of  user  interaction,  making  it  an adaptable and flexible experience.

The exploration of Virtual Worlds leads us to two different visions: a closed Virtual World and an open Virtual World. The closed version, akin to today's digital realm dominated by tech giants, would see the Virtual World controlled by a few powerful entities. Proponents argue that these entities have the resources and experience to facilitate this shift. However, this model risks siloed experiences within proprietary domains. Conversely, advocates for an open Virtual World emphasize the need to reimagine web infrastructure, advocating for a return to interoperable, open systems enhanced by modern digital applications.

Figure 4: Open vs Closed Virtual Worlds (Source: EUBOF Metaverse report,2022)

This debate mirrors the evolution of the web from Web 1.0 (Read-only) to Web 2.0 (Read-write) and now to Web 3.0 (Read-write-own), where blockchain and cryptocurrencies are pivotal in transitioning from centralized to decentralized web models.

Open, permissionless blockchains are crucial in shaping the open  Virtual Worlds, offering the most viable solution for establishing versatile systems for the internet's future. In the open Virtual Worlds, key operations and decision-making processes are decentralized, potentially leading to self-regulated cities or districts with their specific policies, rules, and access criteria. Blockchains offer the flexibility to integrate with current Web 2.0 applications, whether financial or otherwise, and can support the launch of centralized apps or those with centralized elements, like user interfaces. This integration emphasizes the enhancement of user choice.

The  European  Union  Blockchain  Observatory  &amp;  Forum  (EUBOF)  Metaverse  report  provides  an  in-depth explanation.

## 5.4 CBDCs (Central Bank Digital Currencies)

Currently,  the  broader  population,  which  includes  individuals  and  businesses,  can  possess  money  in two primary ways :

- ♦ In physical form , such as coins and banknotes. These are issued by central banks and represent the sole type of central bank currency accessible to the public.
- ♦ Electronically , as seen in accounts maintained with commercial banks and similar regulated entities. These entities can then keep a portion of their funds (referred to as reserves) in accounts with the central bank.
- '{..} the public cannot open accounts directly with the central bank today or hold any form of central-bankissued eMoney. A Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) would change that.' (Giaglis G. 2020)

'A Central Bank Digital Currency, as the name suggests, is a form of digital money that is issued by a central bank. For a value medium to be considered a CBDC it must fulfil both requirements simultaneously (Cœuré et al., 2020). By this definition, CBDCs are not an entirely novel concept. Commercial banks in Europe, the US, and most of the developed world are required to hold a minimum amount of cash, as well as deposits with the central bank in the form of reserves. These reserve accounts fulfil the definition of a CBDC presented above, as they are digital representations of value, recorded as a liability of the central bank and an asset for the commercial bank. '

EUBOF (2021), Central Bank Digital Currencies and a Euro for the Future

CBDCs differ fundamentally from decentralized cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. Unlike these cryptocurrencies that operate on decentralized networks without centralized control, CBDCs are centralized digital currencies issued by central banks. They represent a claim against the issuing central bank. This interest in  CBDCs  by  various  central  banks  globally  is  driven  by  factors  like  the  increasing  popularity  of  digital

payments, a decline in cash usage in certain regions, and the rise of private digital currencies, such as the initially proposed Diem (formerly Libra) by Facebook (now Meta).

Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) may come in two distinct models.

Figure 5: Wholesale vs Retail CBDCs

| Wholesale CBDCs                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Retail CBDCs                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ● Expansion of reserve model to include entities beyond commercial banks. ● Used by commercial banks and central bank-appointed institutions. ● Facilitates payments, remittances, and settlement of financial instruments. | ● Form of legal tender in national currency. ● Fulfils functions of money: medium of exchange, store of value, unit of account. ● Liability of the central bank. ● Asset of the private sector: individuals, households, and businesses. |

CBDCs are also poised to modernize existing financial practices into a digital format. Issued and backed by Central Banks, CBDC holders have a claim against these institutions without exposure to credit or liquidity risks. This digital currency system can help central banks maintain control over monetary policy in a tokenized asset market, provide new tools for regulatory oversight, and lead to more efficient cross-border remittances. Moreover, CBDCs could revolutionize the interbank payment infrastructure  and serve as an alternative to physical  cash,  potentially  transforming  the  relationship  between  central  banks,  commercial  banks,  and depositors.

CBDCs also attract criticism and concern. Financial stability is at risk, as rapid conversion from bank deposits to CBDCs during crises could trigger bank runs. Privacy issues arise with the fear of increased surveillance and central banks' access to transaction data, leading to potential privacy infringements. CBDCs could become magnets  for  cyberattacks,  threatening  individual  savings  and  financial  stability.  They  may  also  limit  the effectiveness of certain economic policies, such as those involving negative interest rates. If CBDCs gain excessive  popularity,  they  could  marginalize  traditional  banking  institutions,  undermining  their  role  and profitability.  The  implementation  of  CBDCs  presents  its  own  challenges,  requiring  extensive  resources  to navigate the technical, regulatory, and logistical hurdles. Moreover, inequality concerns persist, as a CBDC system that isn't inclusively designed may fail to reach segments of the population lacking digital access.

Many nations are exploring and establishing their own iterations of central bank digital currencies (CBDC). The European Central Bank (ECB) is exploring a potential implementation of the 'digital euro' and has conducted various experiments and projects to study the feasibility, benefits, and challenges of launching a digital euro. According to the Atlantic Council, 105 countries are now (2023) engaged in CBDC development, which is three times the number of countries identified as active in this area in 2020.

## 5.5 Interoperability

<!-- image -->

Blockchain interoperability is defined as 'the ability of blockchain networks to communicate with each other, sending and receiving messages, data, and tokens' (Chainlink, 2023). It is an emerging requirement for the continuity of blockchain technology, but it comes with certain challenges as each blockchain system differs in various aspects such as governance models, confirmation speed, consensus robustness, levels of permissibility,  anonymity,  and  the  security  and  reliability  of  its  nodes.  These  variations  make  network coordination complex and create difficulties in achieving standardization.

The  blockchain  landscape  is  currently  fragmented,  with  thousands  of  networks  like  Bitcoin,  Ethereum, Cardano,  and  Ripple  operating  in  isolation  due  to  distinct  protocols  and  mechanisms.  This  lack  of interoperability confines their effectiveness and limits their broader application. Interoperability is vital for linking a fragmented ecosystem, allowing each network to contribute its unique advantages and preventing a new form  of  centralization  where  certain  blockchains  dominate,  thereby  maintaining  blockchain's  ethos  of decentralization.  For  the  widespread  adoption  of  blockchain,  interoperability  is  key.  Different  industries adopting blockchain will need systems capable of exchanging information across various chains. For example, a logistics company using one blockchain should be able to validate transactions with a financial institution on another blockchain. Without this capability, the full commercial potential of blockchain remains unrealized.

In  a  report  published  in  2023,  the  EU  Blockchain  Observatory  and  Forum,  identified  interoperability complexities as below indicated:

1. ensuring transaction finality across different chains
2. managing cross-chain smart contract execution
3. maintaining data integrity during cross-chain communication

It's  important to recognize that the regulatory and legal frameworks governing cross-chain interactions are currently in a state of flux. As the blockchain landscape evolves, these frameworks are continuously adapting to  new  technological  advancements  and  challenges.  Despite  the  considerable  obstacles  that  need  to  be overcome,  the  progress  in  developing  cross-chain  protocols,  bridges,  and  standardizations  of  blockchain technology indicates a positive trajectory toward an increasingly interconnected blockchain ecosystem.

The  potential  of  blockchain  interoperability  extends  across  various  technological  realms,  shaping  a transformative landscape. This interoperability enables technologies like 6G networks, satellite internet, digital twins, and quantum computing to converge, enhancing efficiency, security, and transparency. In the realm of Web  3.0,  interoperability  is  vital  for  the  success  of  a  decentralized  internet,  allowing  diverse  blockchain networks  to  communicate  and  create  efficient  applications  and  services.  It  also  plays  a  crucial  role  in developing  smart  global  ecosystems,  fostering  seamless  data  and  value  exchange  across  industries  and regions.  In  the  creator  economy,  blockchain  interoperability  enhances  cross-chain  transaction  capabilities, paving the way for new revenue streams and improved transparency and accountability for creators. Moreover, it accelerates the transition to a net-zero economy by enabling decentralized energy marketplaces and carbon offset trading, contributing to sustainable and resilient energy systems. Lastly, in the burgeoning realms of the Virtual Worlds and omniverse, blockchain interoperability is key to ensuring data security and enabling the integration of various technologies like IoT, digital twins, and AI. This interconnectedness not only fosters a more equitable and sustainable future but also propels continuous evolution and adaptation of blockchain solutions in these expansive digital ecosystems.

## 5.6 Environmental Concerns and Solutions

<!-- image -->

The environmental impact of blockchain technology has been the topic of discussion for quite some time now, particularly regarding public proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum (before the merge), where there has been severe criticism of the high energy consumption and carbon footprint imposed by the application of the technology. Below, we explain the above concerns:

- Blockchain  networks,  especially  those  utilizing  PoW  consensus  mechanisms,  require  substantial computational power to validate transactions and add new blocks to the chain. This energy-intensive process has raised concerns about the environmental impact, as it often relies on fossil fuels for electricity generation:
- The energy consumption of PoW blockchains directly contributes to their carbon footprint. As miners compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles, they consume vast amounts of electricity, resulting in a significant release of greenhouse gases.
- The rapid advancement of blockchain technology can lead to a high turnover of hardware components, such  as  ASIC  miners  and  GPUs,  which  become  obsolete  relatively  quickly.  The  disposal  of  these electronic devices contributes to electronic waste and its associated environmental issues.

The above concerns may be addressed by exploring alternative consensus mechanisms. Proof-of-Stake (PoS) and  Proof-of-Authority  (PoA) are examples  of more  energy-efficient alternatives.  These  consensus mechanisms  require  validators  to  stake  cryptocurrency  as  collateral  instead  of  solving  resource-intensive puzzles (that require high computational power).

Furthermore, there are some environment-friendly solutions to support the crypto-mining activity that can help reduce the carbon footprint, including renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, or hydroelectric power. There  are  options  that  allow  the  optimisation  of  smart  contracts  and  applications  for  minimizing  energy consumption and the use of resources, which can be beneficial both for the environment and for cutting down operational costs. Newer ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) miners are designed to be more energyefficient than their predecessors, and miners can choose locations with access to renewable energy sources to reduce their carbon footprint.

Several blockchain projects and mining pools have implemented carbon offset programs. These initiatives involve investing in projects that reduce greenhouse gas emissions to balance out the carbon footprint created by blockchain operations.

We have seen blockchain communities becoming  actively  engaged  in  discussions  and  initiatives  to  raise awareness  and  promote  sustainability  (e.g.  Positive  Blockchain,  BC100+).  Raising  awareness  about environmental  concerns  and  supporting  sustainable  and  eco-friendly  blockchain  projects,  can  significantly promote change and enhance the technology adaption.

Blockchain technology has the potential to bring about transformative changes in various industries. Still, it is essential to be aware of its environmental impact and try to contribute to more sustainable solutions that will help the broader adoption and scalability of the technology, reducing environmental concerns as much as possible.

## 6 Regulation of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies

As  blockchain  and  cryptocurrencies  gain  prominence,  regions  worldwide  are  grappling  with  regulatory approaches  for  the  industry.  The  European  Union  has  emerged  as  a  frontrunner,  establishing  the  first

<!-- image -->

comprehensive regulatory framework on a global scale (MiCA). Meanwhile, in the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is aggressively engaging with crypto companies, with various lawsuits while the federal government has introduced a proposed regulation on digital assets. Similarly, Asian countries like Singapore, previously known for their tolerant stance, are now introducing more strict regulations, reflecting a global trend towards tighter oversight of the cryptocurrency market.

## 6.1 Europe

Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) is a regulation in EU law, designed to bring clarity to the cryptoassets market.

MiCA's  proposals  included  regulations  on  crypto-asset  issuance  and  service  providers,  stablecoins,  and measures to prevent market abuse. It is intended to help streamline distributed ledger technology (DLT) and virtual asset regulation in the EU whilst protecting users and investors. MiCA was approved on 20 April 2023 by  the  EU  Parliament  and  will  become  law  in  2024. With MiCA, the EU has become the first leading jurisdiction globally to roll out a detailed regulation framework for the sector.

The European Union is advancing towards a  unified  approach to crypto-asset regulation.  Historically,  EU nations have had their own set of regulations, often disparate and sometimes conflicting, leading to complexity and uncertainty. The new directive aims  to replace these varied regulations with a single, comprehensive framework. This harmonization is expected to diminish confusion, establish the same level for all member states, and facilitate smoother cross-border cryptocurrency transactions within the EU. Such a framework will enhance consistency and  predictability,  bolstering  investor  confidence  and  positioning  the  EU  as  a  prime destination for digital finance innovation.

MiCA aims to establish clear, unified regulations for service providers and token issuers. This approach aims to create standardized guidelines that ensure fairness and protect investors, fostering a more consistent and secure environment for the growth of crypto services and tokens.

MiCA also offers explicit regulatory guidance for crypto assets where traditional financial regulations fall short. As the variety and popularity of crypto services and tokens continue to grow, there's a pressing need for specific guidelines  that  can  adapt  to  the  unique  nature  of  these  digital  assets.  Clear  regulations  will  help  reduce uncertainty,  allowing  for  innovation  and  participation  in  the  market  while  maintaining  robust  consumer protection measures. This clarity is intended to support the fair treatment of investors and users in the dynamic crypto landscape.

According to the  European Securities  and  Markets  Authority  (ESMA),  EU-level  safeguards  and  complaint mechanisms  specific  to  MiCA  will  not  be  in  effect  until  December  2024.  Post-implementation,  states  are expected to enter an 18-month transitional period, during which some protections may not be enforceable until 1st July 2026. Furthermore, National Competent Authorities may face constraints on their supervisory powers over entities that utilize the "grandfathering clause." This clause allows certain operations to continue under pre-existing regulations before the new rules take full effect.

## 6.2 United States of America

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) generally has regulatory authority over the issuance or resale of any token or other digital asset that constitutes a security.  Under U.S. law, a security includes 'an investment contract,' which has been defined by the U.S. Supreme Court as an investment of money in a common  enterprise  with  a  reasonable  expectation  of  profits  to  be  derived  from  the  entrepreneurial  or managerial efforts of others.  SEC v. W.J. Howey Co., 328 U.S. 293, 301 (1946).

In 2023, the Biden-Harris Administration has released proposed regulations on the sale and exchange of digital assets by brokers 'in an effort to crack down on tax cheats while helping law-abiding taxpayers know how much they owe on the sale or exchange of  digital  assets' .  According  to  the  press  release,  the  proposed regulations outline the necessity for digital asset brokers to report specific sales and exchanges. They aim to provide clarity and alignment with tax reporting standards, ensuring that digital asset brokers adhere to the same information reporting rules as brokers dealing with securities and other financial instruments. Numerous well-known crypto experts expressed their concerns that these regulations could further discourage crypto companies from doing business within the United States.

The United States government has also announced in 2023 the National Standards Strategy for Critical and Emerging Technology . According to the document, the US will prioritise standards development in eight areas, including 'digital identity infrastructure and distributed ledger technologies, which increasingly affect a range of key economic sectors'.

In  May  2023,  NY  Attorney  General  James  proposed  'landmark  legislation  to  tighten  regulations  on  the cryptocurrency industry to protect investors, consumers, and the broader economy'. The bill called the Crypto Regulation, Protection, Transparency and Oversight Act (CRPTO) would grant New York officials the authority to  shut  down  businesses  suspected  of  engaging  in  fraud  or  illegal  activity,  issue  subpoenas,  and  apply penalties to crypto firms breaking state law. CRPTO must still be passed by NYC lawmakers for it to become state law.

Throughout 2022 and 2023, the United States has seen an increased regulatory focus on the cryptocurrency industry. The SEC has intensified its oversight and enforcement, particularly examining the crypto market's compliance with securities laws, and has entered multiple legal battles with various crypto companies such as Binance and Ripple. For a comprehensive overview of the SEC's enforcement actions in the cryptocurrency space, please refer to the official SEC press releases and statements on their website.

## 6.3 Asia: Singapore and Hong Kong

Every Asian nation follows a different strategy toward regulating blockchain and cryptocurrencies, varying from strict consumer protection measures to more liberal policies. As crypto regulations are inconsistent in Asian countries and regions, we will focus on Singapore and Hong Kong.

## Singapore:

Singapore is a leading nation  in  blockchain technology, not  only  in  Asia  but  globally,  as  it  endeavours  to balance  fostering  innovation  in  blockchain  and  cryptocurrency  with  implementing  regulatory  measures  to ensure market stability and consumer protection.

In 2023, Singapore updated and introduced new legislation to enhance the regulation of blockchain-based services. These changes involve revisions to the Payment Services Act (PS Act) from 2020 and the new Financial Services and Markets Act. Singapore has recently adopted more stringent rules for cryptocurrencies, aiming to both encourage innovation in this field and maintain effective regulatory control.

Singapore is set to introduce more regulations for closer monitoring of crypto-asset companies, planned to be rolled out progressively from the end of 2023. The aim is to create a more regulated and safer environment for digital assets. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has played a key role in developing and refining regulations for providers of digital payment tokens (DPT). This initiative is critical in creating a more regulated and secure cryptocurrency market in Singapore.

Regarding the Stablecoin Regulatory Framework, in August 2023, the MAS completed a regulatory framework for  stablecoins,  which  marks  a  further  step  in  strengthening  Singapore's  regulatory  approach  to  digital currencies. The MAS has previously released new guidelines that require cryptocurrency service providers to retain client funds in a statutory trust by the end of 2023. The guidelines urge consumers to be vigilant and not deal with unregulated entities, 'as they risk losing all their assets'.

## Hong-Kong

Hong Kong adopts an open stance towards cryptocurrencies, permitting unrestricted trading and usage of digital assets without levying taxes or implementing constraints. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) is adopting a "same risk, same regulation" approach to crypto. The Hong Kong government recognizes the advantages that blockchain technology can bring to various industries, especially in terms of transparency and cost-efficiency, and has even established a Task Force on Promoting Web3 Development.

A 'Licensing Handbook for Virtual Asset Trading Platform Operators' was published by the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) of Hong Kong in 2023. The Handbook provides general information about licensing matters concerning virtual asset trading platform operators and warns that 'It is a serious offence to carry on a regulated activity and/ or VA service in Hong Kong or actively market to the investing public of Hong Kong any services which constitute a regulated activity and/or VA service without the required licence(s)'

In 2023, the HKMA issued a warning to users reminding them 'to beware of firms engaged in crypto business purporting  to  be  'banks'  or  describing  their  products  as  'deposits''.  The  central  bank  emphasised  that, according  to  Hong  Kong's  banking  laws,  only  licensed  institutions  are  permitted  to  engage  in  banking  or deposit-taking activities within the region.
