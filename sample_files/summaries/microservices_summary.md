title:
FROM DESIGN TO DEPLOYMENT: Microservices Architecture with NGINX

abstract:
This e-book, authored by **Chris Richardson** with **Floyd Smith** and copyrighted by **NGINX, Inc.** (2016), provides a comprehensive guide to the **Microservices Architecture** pattern, contrasting it with traditional **Monolithic Applications** and addressing the complexities of modern application development and deployment. The document details the shift from "Monolithic Hell"—characterized by overwhelming complexity, slow development cycles, difficult scaling, and technology lock-in—to an architecture composed of smaller, interconnected, independently deployable services.

The guide is structured across seven chapters covering core microservices issues:
1.  **Introduction to Microservices**, including their benefits (managing complexity, technological freedom, independent deployment) and drawbacks.
2.  The implementation of an **API Gateway** as a single point of entry for managing load balancing, caching, and access control, with a focus on using **NGINX Plus**.
3.  **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**, exploring various synchronous (like **REST**, Thrift) and asynchronous (message-based) methods for services to "speak" to one another.
4.  **Service Discovery** patterns (Client-Side and Server-Side) and the use of a **Service Registry** in dynamic environments.
5.  **Event-Driven Data Management**, emphasizing the necessity of separate data stores per service (polyglot persistence) and techniques for achieving data atomicity.
6.  Different **Microservices Deployment Strategies** (e.g., Service Instance per Host/Container, Serverless Deployment).
7.  A practical approach to **Refactoring a Monolith into Microservices** using strategies like "Stop Digging" and "Extract Services."

Throughout the document, sidebars and dedicated "Microservices in Action" sections illustrate how **NGINX** software can be used effectively as a reverse proxy, API Gateway, and in application architecture to ensure smooth operation, load balancing, and storage optimization for microservices-based solutions.
