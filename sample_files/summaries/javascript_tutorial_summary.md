JAVASCRIPT - Beginner's Tutorial

abstract:
This document, a tutorial published by **Tutorials Point** (via their "simplyeasylearning" branch), provides a comprehensive introduction to the **JavaScript** programming language aimed at beginners. It starts by defining JavaScript as a **lightweight**, **interpreted**, **open**, and **cross-platform** language primarily designed for creating **network-centric applications** and is complementary to and integrated with Java and HTML. The guide is structured to help beginners understand the basic functionality of JavaScript for building **dynamic web pages and web applications**. Prerequisites include prior knowledge of **HTML coding** and an understanding of object-oriented programming concepts. The first part of the tutorial, "JAVASCRIPT BASICS," covers an overview of the language, including its definition, **Client-Side** usage, advantages (ease of implementation, integration with HTML), and limitations. It also explores development tools, the current use of JavaScript ("Where is JavaScript Today?"), and fundamental **Syntax** rules (First Code, Whitespace, Semicolons, Case Sensitivity, Comments). Subsequent sections delve into practical implementation, detailing how to **Enable** JavaScript in various browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, Opera) and how to include code in different parts of an HTML document (in `<head>`, `<body>`, or via an **External File**). Finally, the tutorial introduces core programming concepts, specifically covering **Variables** (declaration, scope, naming rules, and **Reserved Words**) and an overview of different **Operators**, including **Arithmetic**, **Comparison**, and **Logical** types. The document concludes with a discussion of datatypes. The tutorial is copyrighted by Tutorials Point (I) Pvt. Ltd. (2015).
