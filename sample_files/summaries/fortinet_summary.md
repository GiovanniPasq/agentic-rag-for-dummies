Fortinet FortiGate™ Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW) with FortiOS 5.2 (CC Compliant Firmware) - Security Target (ST)

abstract:
This Security Target (ST) document (Version 1.5, 20 September 2016) defines the Target of Evaluation (TOE) for Fortinet FortiGate™ Next Generation Firewalls (NGFW), aiming for an Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) EAL4+ certification. The TOE includes specific hardware models (e.g., Desktop, 1U) and virtual models running the Common Criteria (CC) Compliant Firmware, FortiOS 5.2. Prepared by EWA - Canada, the document details the TOE's physical and logical scope, including configurations like High Availability (HA). It outlines the Security Problem Definition (threats, policies, assumptions) and Security Objectives. The analysis focuses on Security Functional Requirements (SFRs), including: Security Audit (FAU), Cryptographic Support (FCS), User Data Protection (FDP) (with traffic filtering), Identification and Authentication (FIA), Security Management (FMT), Protection of the TSF (FPT), and Trusted Path/Channels (FTP). It also specifies extended components for Intrusion Prevention (IPS) (FIP) and Anti-Virus (AV) (FAV). The TOE Summary Specification (Section 7) details how these security functions meet the defined requirements. Annex A lists models supported by the firmware but not included in this specific evaluation.
