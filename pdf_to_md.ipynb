        "\n",
        "Before building your RAG system, you’ll need to convert your PDF documents into a machine-readable format. While **Markdown** is a common choice, you can also export to other formats such as **JSON**, **TXT**, or others depending on your pipeline and requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are two main approaches you can use:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Option 1: VLM-Based Conversion (Recommended for Complex Documents)\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach uses a **Vision-Language Model (VLM)** to visually process each PDF page. It extracts text, preserves the original layout, and generates descriptions for visual elements such as images, tables, and charts.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Why choose this method?\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Best for:** Complex layouts, multi-column documents, tables, charts, and image-heavy PDFs.  \n",
        "- **Pros:** High accuracy and excellent handling of both text and non-text elements.  \n",
        "- **Cons:** Higher computational cost and slower performance on large document batches.  \n",
        "\n",
        "The examples below demonstrate how to use the **Google Gemini API** for VLM-based conversion. However, you can easily adapt this approach to other models or frameworks—such as **OpenAI**, **Ollama**, **Claude**, or **Hugging Face**—based on your tools and infrastructure.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more information, see the official documentation:  \n",
